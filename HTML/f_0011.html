<p class="ni">The three of crows have flapped it southenly, kraaking of de <br />
baccle to the kvarters of that sky whence triboos answer; Wail, <br />
’tis well! She niver comes out when Thon’s on shower or when <br />
Thon’s flash with his Nixy girls or when Thon’s blowing toom- <br />
cracks down the gaels of Thon. No nubo no! Neblas on you liv! <br />
Her would be too moochy afreet. Of Burymeleg and Bindme- <br />
rollingeyes and all the deed in the woe. Fe fo fom! She jist does <br />
hopes till byes will be byes. Here, and it goes on to appear now, <br />
she comes, a peacefugle, a parody’s bird, a peri potmother, <br />
a pringlpik in the ilandiskippy, with peewee and powwows <br />
in beggybaggy on her bickybacky and a flick flask fleckflinging <br />
its pixylighting pacts’ huemeramybows, picking here, pecking <br />
there, pussypussy plunderpussy. But it’s the armitides toonigh, <br />
militopucos, and toomourn we wish for a muddy kissmans to the <br />
minutia workers and there’s to be a gorgeups truce for happinest <br />
childher everwere. Come nebo me and suso sing the day we <br />
sallybright. She’s burrowed the coacher’s headlight the better to <br />
pry (who goes cute goes siocur and shoos aroun) and all spoiled <br />
goods go into her nabsack: curtrages and rattlin buttins, nappy <br />
spattees and flasks of all nations, clavicures and scampulars, maps, <br />
keys and woodpiles of haypennies and moonled brooches with <br />
bloodstaned breeks in em, boaston nightgarters and masses of <br />
shoesets and nickelly nacks and foder allmicheal and a lugly parson <br />
of cates and howitzer muchears and midgers and maggets, ills and <br />
ells with loffs of toffs and pleures of bells and the last sigh that <br />
come fro the hart (bucklied!) and the fairest sin the sunsaw <br />
(that’s cearc!). With Kiss. Kiss Criss. Cross Criss. Kiss Cross. <br />
Undo lives ’end. Slain.</p>

<p>How bootifull and how truetowife of her, when strengly fore- <br />
bidden, to steal our historic presents from the past postpropheti- <br />
cals so as to will make us all lordy heirs and ladymaidesses of a <br />
pretty nice kettle of fruit. She is livving in our midst of debt and <br />
laffing through all plores for us (her birth is uncontrollable), with <br />
a naperon for her mask and her sabboes kickin arias (so sair! so <br />
solly!) if yous ask me and I saack you. Hou! Hou! Gricks may <br />
rise and Troysirs fall (there being two sights for ever a picture)<span></span></p>
