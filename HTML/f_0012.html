<p class="ni">for in the byways of high improvidence that’s what makes life- <br />
work leaving and the world’s a cell for citters to cit in. Let young <br />
wimman run away with the story and let young min talk smooth <br />
behind the butteler’s back. She knows her knight’s duty while <br />
Luntum sleeps. Did ye save any tin? says he. Did I what? with <br />
a grin says she. And we all like a marriedann because she is mer- <br />
cenary. Though the length of the land lies under liquidation <br />
(floote!) and there’s nare a hairbrow nor an eyebush on this glau- <br />
brous phace of Herrschuft Whatarwelter she’ll loan a vesta and <br />
hire some peat and sarch the shores her cockles to heat and she’ll <br />
do all a turfwoman can to piff the business on. Paff. To puff the <br />
blaziness on. Poffpoff. And even if Humpty shell fall frumpty <br />
times as awkward again in the beardsboosoloom of all our grand <br />
remonstrancers there’ll be iggs for the brekkers come to mourn- <br />
him, sunny side up with care. So true is it that therewhere’s a <br />
turnover the tay is wet too and when you think you ketch sight <br />
of a hind make sure but you’re cocked by a hin.</p>

<p>Then as she is on her behaviourite job of quainance bandy, <br />
fruting for firstlings and taking her tithe, we may take our review <br />
of the two mounds to see nothing of the himples here as at else- <br />
where, by sixes and sevens, like so many heegills and collines, <br />
sitton aroont, scentbreeched ant somepotreek, in their swisha- <br />
wish satins and their taffetaffe tights, playing Wharton’s Folly, <br />
at a treepurty on the planko in the purk. Stand up, mickos! <br />
Make strake for minnas! By order, Nicholas Proud. We may see <br />
and hear nothing if we choose of the shortlegged bergins off <br />
Corkhill or the bergamoors of Arbourhill or the bergagambols <br />
of Summerhill or the bergincellies of Miseryhill or the country- <br />
bossed bergones of Constitutionhill though every crowd has its <br />
several tones and every trade has its clever mechanics and each <br />
harmonical has a point of its own, Olaf’s on the rise and Ivor’s <br />
on the lift and Sitric’s place’s between them. But all they are all <br />
there scraping along to sneeze out a likelihood that will solve <br />
and salve life’s robulous rebus, hopping round his middle like <br />
kippers on a griddle, O, as he lays dormont from the macroborg <br />
of Holdhard to the microbirg of Pied de Poudre. Behove this<span></span></p>
