<p class="ni">hadde a wickered Kish for to hale dead tunes from the bog look- <br />
it under the blay of her Kish as she ran for to sothisfeige her cow- <br />
rieosity and be me sawl but she found hersell sackvulle of swart <br />
goody quickenshoon ant small illigant brogues, so rich in sweat. <br />
Blurry works at Hurdlesford.</p>

<p>(Silent.)</p>

<p>566 A.D. At this time it fell out that a brazenlockt damsel grieved <br />
(<em>sobralasolas!</em>) because that Puppette her minion was ravisht-of her <br />
by the ogre Puropeus Pious. Bloody wars in Ballyaughacleeagh- <br />
bally.</p>

<p>1132 A.D. Two sons at an hour were born until a goodman <br />
and his hag. These sons called themselves Caddy and Primas. <br />
Primas was a santryman and drilled all decent people. Caddy <br />
went to Winehouse and wrote o peace a farce. Blotty words for <br />
Dublin.</p>

<p>Somewhere, parently, in the ginnandgo gap between antedilu- <br />
vious and annadominant the copyist must have fled with his <br />
scroll. The billy flood rose or an elk charged him or the sultrup <br />
worldwright from the excelsissimost empyrean (bolt, in sum) <br />
earthspake or the Dannamen gallous banged pan the bliddy du- <br />
ran. A scribicide then and there is led off under old’s code with <br />
some fine covered by six marks or ninepins in metalmen for the <br />
sake of his labour’s dross while it will be only now and again in <br />
our rear of o’er era, as an upshoot of military and civil engage- <br />
ments, that a gynecure was let on to the scuffold for taking that <br />
same fine sum covertly by meddlement with the drawers of his <br />
neighbour’s safe.</p>

<p>Now after all that farfatch’d and peragrine or dingnant or clere <br />
lift we our ears, eyes of the darkness, from the tome of <em>Liber Li- <br />
vidus</em> and, (toh!), how paisibly eirenical, all dimmering dunes <br />
and gloamering glades, selfstretches afore us our fredeland’s plain! <br />
Lean neath stone pine the pastor lies with his crook; young pric- <br />
ket by pricket’s sister nibbleth on returned viridities; amaid her <br />
rocking grasses the herb trinity shams lowliness; skyup is of ever- <br />
grey. Thus, too, for donkey’s years. Since the bouts of Hebear <br />
and Hairyman the cornflowers have been staying at Ballymun,<span></span></p>
