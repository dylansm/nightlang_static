<p class="ni">the duskrose has choosed out Goatstown’s hedges, twolips have <br />
pressed togatherthem by sweet Rush, townland of twinedlights, <br />
the whitethorn and the redthorn have fairygeyed the mayvalleys <br />
of Knockmaroon, and, though for rings round them, during a <br />
chiliad of perihelygangs, the Formoreans have brittled the too- <br />
ath of the Danes and the Oxman has been pestered by the Fire- <br />
bugs and the Joynts have thrown up jerrybuilding to the Kevan- <br />
ses and Little on the Green is childsfather to the City (Year! <br />
Year! And laughtears!), these paxsealing buttonholes have quad- <br />
rilled across the centuries and whiff now whafft to us, fresh and <br />
made-of-all-smiles as, on the eve of Killallwho.</p>

<p>The babbelers with their thangas vain have been (confusium <br />
hold them!) they were and went; thigging thugs were and hou- <br />
hnhymn songtoms were and comely norgels were and pollyfool <br />
fiansees. Menn have thawed, clerks have surssurhummed, the <br />
blond has sought of the brune: Elsekiss thou may, mean Kerry <br />
piggy?: and the duncledames have countered with the hellish fel- <br />
lows: Who ails tongue coddeau, aspace of dumbillsilly? And they <br />
fell upong one another: and themselves they have fallen. And <br />
still nowanights and by nights of yore do all bold floras of the <br />
field to their shyfaun lovers say only: Cull me ere I wilt to thee!: <br />
and, but a little later: Pluck me whilst I blush! Well may they <br />
wilt, marry, and profusedly blush, be troth! For that saying is as <br />
old as the howitts. Lave a whale a while in a whillbarrow (isn’t <br />
it the truath I’m tallin ye?) to have fins and flippers that shimmy <br />
and shake. Tim Timmycan timped hir, tampting Tam. Fleppety! <br />
