<p class="ni">part so ptee does duty for the holos we soon grow to use of an <br />
allforabit. Here (please to stoop) are selveran cued peteet peas of <br />
quite a pecuniar interest inaslittle as they are the pellets that make <br />
the tomtummy’s pay roll. Right rank ragnar rocks and with these <br />
rox orangotangos rangled rough and rightgorong. Wisha, wisha, <br />
whydidtha? Thik is for thorn that’s thuck in its thoil like thum- <br />
fool’s thraitor thrust for vengeance. What a mnice old mness it <br />
all mnakes! A middenhide hoard of objects! Olives, beets, kim- <br />
mells, dollies, alfrids, beatties, cormacks and daltons. Owlets’ eegs <br />
(O stoop to please!) are here, creakish from age and all now <br />
quite epsilene, and oldwolldy wobblewers, haudworth a wipe o <br />
grass. Sss! See the snake wurrums everyside! Our durlbin is <br />
sworming in sneaks. They came to our island from triangular <br />
Toucheaterre beyond the wet prairie rared up in the midst of the <br />
cargon of prohibitive pomefructs but along landed Paddy Wip- <br />
pingham and the his garbagecans cotched the creeps of them <br />

<p>Axe on thwacks on thracks, axenwise. One by one place one <br />

ible free and idim behind. Starting off with a big boaboa and three- <br />
legged calvers and ivargraine jadesses with a message in their <br />
mouths. And a hundreadfilled unleavenweight of liberorumqueue <br />
to con an we can till allhorrors eve. What a meanderthalltale to <br />
unfurl and with what an end in view of squattor and anntisquattor <br />
and postproneauntisquattor! To say too us to be every tim, nick <br />

<p>True there was in nillohs dieybos as yet no lumpend papeer <br />

to let flee. All was of ancientry. You gave me a boot (signs on <br />
it!) and I ate the wind. I quizzed you a quid (with for what?) and <br />
you went to the quod. But the world, mind, is, was and will be <br />
writing its own wrunes for ever, man, on all matters that fall<span></span></p>
