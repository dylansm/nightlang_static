<p>It was of a night, late, lang time agone, in an auldstane eld, <br />
when Adam was delvin and his madameen spinning watersilts, <br />
when mulk mountynotty man was everybully and the first leal <br />
ribberrobber that ever had her ainway everybuddy to his love- <br />
saking eyes and everybilly lived alove with everybiddy else, and <br />
Jarl van Hoother had his burnt head high up in his lamphouse, <br />
laying cold hands on himself. And his two little jiminies, cousins <br />

was a brannewail that same sabboath night of falling angles some- <br />
where in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years’ <br />
walk in Tourlemonde and she washed the blessings of the love- <br />
spots off the jiminy with soap sulliver suddles and she had her <br />
four owlers masters for to tauch him his tickles and she convor- <br />
