<p class="ni">the dummy in their first infancy were below on the tearsheet, <br />
wringing and coughing, like brodar and histher. And the prank- <br />
quean nipped a paly one and lit up again and redcocks flew flack- <br />
ering from the hillcombs. And she made her witter before the <br />
wicked, saying: Mark the Twy, why do I am alook alike two poss <br />
of porterpease? And: Shut! says the wicked, handwording her <br />
madesty. So her madesty aforethought set down a jiminy and <br />
took up a jiminy and all the lilipath ways to Woeman’s Land she <br />
rain, rain, rain. And Jarl von Hoother bleethered atter her with <br />
a loud finegale: Stop domb stop come back with my earring stop. <br />
But the prankquean swaradid: Am liking it. And there was a wild <br />
old grannewwail that laurency night of starshootings somewhere <br />

And Jarl von Hoother had his hurricane hips up to his pantry- <br />
box, ruminating in his holdfour stomachs (Dare! O dare!), ant <br />
the jiminy Toughertrees and the dummy were belove on the <br />
watercloth, kissing and spitting, and roguing and poghuing, like <br />
knavepaltry and naivebride and in their second infancy. And the <br />
prankquean picked a blank and lit out and the valleys lay twink- <br />
ling. And she made her wittest in front of the arkway of trihump, <br />
asking: Mark the Tris, why do I am alook alike three poss of por- <br />
ter pease? But that was how the skirtmishes endupped. For like <br />
the campbells acoming with a fork lance of-lightning, Jarl von <br />
Hoother Boanerges himself, the old terror of the dames, came <br />
hip hop handihap out through the pikeopened arkway of his <br />
