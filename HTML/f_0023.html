<p class="ni">framed panuncular cumbottes like a rudd yellan gruebleen or- <br />
angeman in his violet indigonation, to the whole longth of the <br />
strongth of his bowman’s bill. And he clopped his rude hand to <br />
his eacy hitch and he ordurd and his thick spch spck for her to <br />
shut up shop, dappy. And the duppy shot the shutter clup (Per- <br />
kodhuskurunbarggruauyagokgorlayorgromgremmitghundhurth- <br />
rumathunaradidillifaititillibumullunukkunun!) And they all drank <br />
free. For one man in his armour was a fat match always for any <br />
girls under shurts. And that was the first peace of illiterative <br />
porthery in all the flamend floody flatuous world. How kirssy the <br />
tiler made a sweet unclose to the Narwhealian captol. Saw fore <br />
shalt thou sea. Betoun ye and be. The prankquean was to hold <br />
her dummyship and the jimminies was to keep the peacewave <br />
and van Hoother was to git the wind up. Thus the hearsomeness <br />
of the burger felicitates the whole of the polis.</p>

<p>O foenix culprit! Ex nickylow malo comes mickelmassed bo- <br />

Norronesen or Irenean the secrest of their soorcelossness. Quar- <br />

evesdrip, were it mous at hand, were it dinn of bottles in the far <br />

all to time of thuch on thuch and thow on thow. She he she ho <br />

he abhears. The soundwaves are his buffeteers; they trompe him <br />
with their trompes; the wave of roary and the wave of hooshed <br />
and the wave of hawhawhawrd and the wave of neverheedthem- <br />
horseluggarsandlisteltomine. Landloughed by his neaghboormis- <br />
tress and perpetrified in his offsprung, sabes and suckers, the <br />
moaning pipers could tell him to his faceback, the louthly one <br />
whose loab we are devorers of, how butt for his hold halibutt, or <br />
her to her pudor puff, the lipalip one whose libe we drink at, how <br />
biff for her tiddywink of a windfall, our breed and washer givers, <br />
there would not be a holey spier on the town nor a vestal flout- <br />
