all belonging to him and he sweated his crew beneath his auspice <br />
for the living and he urned his dread, that dragon volant, and he <br />
made louse for us and delivered us to boll weevils amain, that <br />
mighty liberator, Unfru-Chikda-Uru-Wukru and begad he did, <br />

is hard as Nugent knew, to leave the clean tanglesome one lushier <br />

no grievance. You’re better off, sir, where you are, primesigned <br />
in the full of your dress, bloodeagle waistcoat and all, remember- <br />
