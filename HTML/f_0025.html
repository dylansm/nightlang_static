<p class="ni">you presents, won’t we, fenians? And il isn’t our spittle we’ll stint <br />
you of, is it, druids? Not shabbty little imagettes, pennydirts and <br />
dodgemyeyes you buy in the soottee stores. But offerings of the <br />
field. Mieliodories, that Doctor Faherty, the madison man, <br />
taught to gooden you. Poppypap’s a passport out. And honey is <br />
the holiest thing ever was, hive, comb and earwax, the food for <br />
glory, (mind you keep the pot or your nectar cup may yield too <br />
light!) and some goat’s milk, sir, like the maid used to bring you. <br />
Your fame is spreading like Basilico’s ointment since the Fintan <br />
Lalors piped you overborder and there’s whole households be- <br />
yond the Bothnians and they calling names after you. The men- <br />
here’s always talking of you sitting around on the pig’s cheeks <br />
under the sacred rooftree, over the bowls of memory where every <br />
hollow holds a hallow, with a pledge till the drengs, in the Salmon <br />
House. And admiring to our supershillelagh where the palmsweat <br />
on high is the mark of your manument. All the toethpicks ever <br />
Eirenesians chewed on are chips chepped from that battery <br />
block. If you were bowed and soild and letdown itself from the <br />
oner of the load it was that paddyplanters might pack up plenty and <br />
when you were undone in every point fore the laps of goddesses <br />
you showed our labourlasses how to free was easy. The game old <br />
Gunne, they do be saying, (skull!) that was a planter for you, a <br />
spicer of them all. Begog but he was, the G.O.G! He’s dudd- <br />
andgunne now and we’re apter finding the sores of his sedeq <br />
but peace to his great limbs, the buddhoch, with the last league <br />
long rest of him, while the millioncandled eye of Tuskar sweeps <br />
the Moylean Main! There was never a warlord in Great Erinnes <br />
and Brettland, no, nor in all Pike County like you, they say. No, <br />
nor a king nor an ardking, bung king, sung king or hung king. <br />
That you could fell an elmstree twelve urchins couldn’t ring <br />
round and hoist high the stone that Liam failed. Who but a Mac- <br />
cullaghmore the reise of our fortunes and the faunayman at the <br />
funeral to compass our cause? If you was hogglebully itself and <br />
most frifty like you was taken waters still what all where was <br />
your like to lay the cable or who was the batter could better <br />
