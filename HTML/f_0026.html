<p class="ni">the pure perfection and Leatherbags Reynolds tries your shuffle <br />
and cut. But as Hopkins and Hopkins puts it, you were the pale <br />
eggynaggy and a kis to tilly up. We calls him the journeyall <br />
Buggaloffs since he went Jerusalemfaring in Arssia Manor. You <br />
had a gamier cock than Pete, Jake or Martin and your archgoose <br />
of geese stubbled for All Angels’ Day. So may the priest of seven <br />
worms and scalding tayboil, Papa Vestray, come never anear you <br />
as your hair grows wheater beside the Liffey that’s in Heaven! <br />
Hep, hep, hurrah there! Hero! Seven times thereto we salute <br />
you! The whole bag of kits, falconplumes and jackboots incloted, <br />
is where you flung them that time. Your heart is in the system <br />
of the Shewolf and your crested head is in the tropic of Copri- <br />
capron. Your feet are in the cloister of Virgo. Your olala is in the <br />
region of sahuls. And that’s ashore as you were born. Your shuck <br />
tick’s swell. And that there texas is tow linen. The loamsome <br />
roam to Laffayette is ended. Drop in your tracks, babe! Be not <br />
unrested! The headboddylwatcher of the chempel of Isid, <br />
Totumcalmum, saith: I know thee, metherjar, I know thee, sal- <br />
vation boat. For we have performed upon thee, thou abrama- <br />
nation, who comest ever without being invoked, whose coming <br />
is unknown, all the things which the company of the precentors <br />
and of the grammarians of Christpatrick’s ordered concerning <br />
thee in the matter of the work of thy tombing. Howe of the ship- <br />
men, steep wall!</p>

<p>Everything’s going on the same or so it appeals to all of us, <br />
in the old holmsted here. Coughings all over the sanctuary, bad <br />
scrant to me aunt Florenza. The horn for breakfast, one o’gong <br />
for lunch and dinnerchime. As popular as when Belly the First <br />
was keng and his members met in the Diet of Man. The same <br />
shop slop in the window. Jacob’s lettercrackers and Dr Tipple’s <br />
Vi-Cocoa and the Eswuards’ desippated soup beside Mother Sea- <br />
gull’s syrup. Meat took a drop when Reilly-Parsons failed. Coal’s <br />
short but we’ve plenty of bog in the yard. And barley’s up again, <br />
begrained to it. The lads is attending school nessans regular, sir, <br />
spelling beesknees with hathatansy and turning out tables by <br />
mudapplication. Allfor the books and never pegging smashers<span></span></p>
