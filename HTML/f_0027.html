<p class="ni">after Tom Bowe Glassarse or Timmy the Tosser. ’Tisraely the <br />
truth! No isn’t it, roman pathoricks? You were the doublejoynted <br />
janitor the morning they were delivered and you’ll be a grandfer <br />
yet entirely when the ritehand seizes what the lovearm knows. <br />
Kevin’s just a doat with his cherub cheek, chalking oghres on <br />
walls, and his little lamp and schoolbelt and bag of knicks, playing <br />
postman’s knock round the diggings and if the seep were milk <br />
you could lieve his olde by his ide but, laus sake, the devil does <br />
be in that knirps of a Jerry sometimes, the tarandtan plaidboy, <br />
making encostive inkum out of the last of his lavings and writing <br />
a blue streak over his bourseday shirt. Hetty Jane’s a child of <br />
Mary. She’ll be coming (for they’re sure to choose her) in her <br />
white of gold with a tourch of ivy to rekindle the flame on Felix <br />
Day. But Essie Shanahan has let down her skirts. You remember <br />
Essie in our Luna’s Convent? They called her Holly Merry her <br />
lips were so ruddyberry and Pia de Purebelle when the redminers <br />
riots was on about her. Were I a clerk designate to the Williams- <br />
woodsmenufactors I’d poster those pouters on every jamb in the <br />
town. She’s making her rep at Lanner’s twicenightly. With the <br />
tabarine tamtammers of the whirligigmagees. Beats that cachucha <br />
flat. ’Twould dilate your heart to go.</p>

<p>Aisy now, you decent man, with your knees and lie quiet and <br />
repose your honour’s lordship! Hold him here, Ezekiel Irons, and <br />
may God strengthen you! It’s our warm spirits, boys, he’s spoor- <br />
ing. Dimitrius O’Flagonan, cork that cure for the Clancartys! You <br />
swamped enough since Portobello to float the Pomeroy. Fetch <br />
neahere, Pat Koy! And fetch nouyou, Pam Yates! Be nayther <br />
angst of Wramawitch! Here’s lumbos. Where misties swaddlum, <br />
where misches lodge none, where mystries pour kind on, O <br />
sleepy! So be yet!</p>

<p>I’ve an eye on queer Behan and old Kate and the butter, trust me. <br />
She’ll do no jugglywuggly with her war souvenir postcards to <br />
help to build me murial, tippers! I’ll trip your traps! Assure a <br />
sure there! And we put on your clock again, sir, for you. Did or <br />
didn’t we, sharestutterers? So you won’t be up a stump entirely. <br />
Nor shed your remnants. The sternwheel’s crawling strong. I<span></span></p>
