herself that’s fine, too, don’t be talking! Shirksends? You storyan <br />

good trout. Shakeshands. Dibble a hayfork’s wrong with her only <br />
her lex’s salig. Boald Tib does be yawning and smirking cat’s <br />
hours on the Pollockses’ woolly round tabouretcushion watch- <br />
ing her sewing a dream together, the tailor’s daughter, stitch to <br />
her last. Or while waiting for winter to fire the enchantement, <br />
decoying more nesters to fall down the flue. It’s allavalonche that <br />
blows nopussy food. If you only were there to explain the mean- <br />
ing, best of men, and talk to her nice of guldenselver. The lips <br />
would moisten once again. As when you drove with her to Fin- <br />
drinny Fair. What with reins here and ribbons there all your <br />
hands were employed so she never knew was she on land or at <br />
sea or swooped through the blue like Airwinger’s bride. She <br />
was flirtsome then and she’s fluttersome yet. She can second a <br />
song and adores a scandal when the last post’s gone by. Fond of <br />
a concertina and pairs passing when she’s had her forty winks <br />
for supper after kanekannan and abbely dimpling and is in her <br />
merlin chair assotted, reading her Evening World. To see is <br />
it smarts, full lengths or swaggers. News, news, all the news. <br />
Death, a leopard, kills fellah in Fez. Angry scenes at Stormount. <br />
Stilla Star with her lucky in goingaways. Opportunity fair with <br />
the China floods and we hear these rosy rumours. Ding Tams he <br />
noise about all same Harry chap. She’s seeking her way, a chickle <br />
a chuckle, in and out of their serial story, <em>Les Loves of Selskar <br />
et Pervenche</em>, freely adapted to <em>The Novvergin’s Viv</em>. There’ll <br />
be bluebells blowing in salty sepulchres the night she signs her <br />
final tear. Zee End. But that’s a world of ways away. Till track <br />
laws time. No silver ash or switches for that one! While flattering <br />
candles flare. Anna Stacey’s how are you! Worther waist in the <br />
noblest, says Adams and Sons, the wouldpay actionneers. Her <br />
hair’s as brown as ever it was. And wivvy and wavy. Repose you <br />
now! Finn no more!</p>
