<p class="ni">haunt of the hungred bordles, as it is told me. Shop Illicit, <br />
flourishing like a lordmajor or a buaboabaybohm, litting flop <br />
a deadlop (aloose!) to lee but lifting a bennbranch a yardalong <br />
(Ivoeh!) the breezy side (for showm!), the height of Brew- <br />
ster’s chimpney and as broad below as Phineas Barnum; humph- <br />
ing his share of the showthers is senken on him he’s such a <br />
grandfallar, with a pocked wife in pickle that’s a flyfire and three <br />
lice nittle clinkers, two twilling bugs and one midgit pucelle. <br />
And aither he cursed and recursed and was everseen doing what <br />
your fourfootlers saw or he was never done seeing what you cool- <br />
pigeons know, weep the clouds aboon for smiledown witnesses, <br />
and that’ll do now about the fairyhees and the frailyshees. <br />
Though Eset fibble it to the zephiroth and Artsa zoom it round <br />
her heavens for ever. Creator he has created for his creatured <br />
ones a creation. White monothoid? Red theatrocrat? And all the <br />
pinkprophets cohalething? Very much so! But however ’twas <br />
’tis sure for one thing, what sherif Toragh voucherfors and <br />
Mapqiq makes put out, that the man, Humme the Cheapner, <br />
Esc, overseen as we thought him, yet a worthy of the naym, <br />
came at this timecoloured place where we live in our paroqial <br />
fermament one tide on another, with a bumrush in a hull of a <br />
wherry, the twin turbane dhow, <em>The Bey for Dybbling</em>, this <br />
archipelago’s first visiting schooner, with a wicklowpattern <br />
waxenwench at her prow for a figurehead, the deadsea dugong <br />
updipdripping from his depths, and has been repreaching him- <br />
self like a fishmummer these siktyten years ever since, his shebi <br />
by his shide, adi and aid, growing hoarish under his turban and <br />
changing cane sugar into sethulose starch (Tuttut’s cess to him!) <br />
as also that, batin the bulkihood he bloats about when innebbi- <br />
ated, our old offender was humile, commune and ensectuous <br />
from his nature, which you may gauge after the bynames was <br />
put under him, in lashons of languages, (honnein suit and <br />
praisers be!) and, totalisating him, even hamissim of himashim <br />
that he, sober serious, he is ee and no counter he who will be <br />
ultimendly respunchable for the hubbub caused in Eden- <br />
borough.</p>
