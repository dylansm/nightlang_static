<p class="ni">flagrant marl, jingling his turnpike keys and bearing aloft amid <br />
the fixed pikes of the hunting party a high perch atop of which a <br />
flowerpot was fixed earthside hoist with care. On his majesty, who <br />
was, or often feigned to be, noticeably longsighted from green <br />
youth and had been meaning to inquire what, in effect, had caused <br />
yon causeway to be thus potholed, asking substitutionally to be <br />
put wise as to whether paternoster and silver doctors were not <br />
now more fancied bait for lobstertrapping honest blunt Harom- <br />
phreyld answered in no uncertain tones very similarly with a fear- <br />
less forehead: Naw, yer maggers, aw war jist a cotchin on thon <br />
bluggy earwuggers. Our sailor king, who was draining a gugglet <br />
of obvious adamale, gift both and gorban, upon this, ceasing to <br />
swallow, smiled most heartily beneath his walrus moustaches and <br />
indulging that none too genial humour which William the Conk <br />
on the spindle side had inherited with the hereditary whitelock <br />
and some shortfingeredness from his greataunt Sophy, turned to- <br />
wards two of his retinue of gallowglasses, Michael, etheling lord <br />
of Leix and Offaly and the jubilee mayor of Drogheda, Elcock, <br />
(the two scatterguns being Michael M. Manning, protosyndic of <br />
Waterford and an Italian excellency named Giubilei according to <br />
a later version cited by the learned scholarch Canavan of Can- <br />
makenoise), in either case a triptychal religious family symbolising <br />
puritas of doctrina, business per usuals and the purchypatch of <br />
hamlock where the paddish preties grow and remarked dilsydul- <br />
sily: Holybones of Saint Hubert how our red brother of Pour- <br />
ingrainia would audibly fume did he know that we have for sur- <br />
trusty bailiwick a turnpiker who is by turns a pikebailer no sel- <br />
domer than an earwigger For he kinned Jom Pill with his court <br />
so gray and his haunts in his house in the mourning. (One still <br />
hears that pebble crusted laughta, japijap cheerycherrily, among <br />
the roadside tree the lady Holmpatrick planted and still one feels <br />
the amossive silence of the cladstone allegibelling: Ive mies outs <br />
ide Bourn.) Comes the question are these the facts of his nom- <br />
inigentilisation as recorded and accolated in both or either of the <br />
collateral andrewpaulmurphyc narratives. Are those their fata <br />
which we read in sibylline between the <em>fas</em> and its <em>nefas?</em> No dung<span></span></p>
