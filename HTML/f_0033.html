Maccabe and Cullen) where, a veritable Napoleon the Nth, our <br />
worldstage’s practical jokepiece and retired cecelticocommediant <br />
in his own wise, this folksforefather all of the time sat, having the <br />
entirety of his house about him, with the invariable broadstretched <br />
kerchief cooling his whole neck, nape and shoulderblades and in <br />
a wardrobe panelled tuxedo completely thrown back from a shirt <br />
well entitled a swallowall, on every point far outstarching the <br />
laundered clawhammers and marbletopped highboys of the pit <br />
stalls and early amphitheatre. The piece was this: look at the lamps. <br />
The cast was thus: see under the clock. Ladies circle: cloaks may <br />
be left. Pit, prommer and parterre, standing room only. Habituels <br />
conspicuously emergent.</p>

<p>A baser meaning has been read into these characters the literal <br />
sense of which decency can safely scarcely hint. It has been blur- <br />
tingly bruited by certain wisecrackers (the stinks of Mohorat are <br />
in the nightplots of the morning), that he suffered from a vile <br />
disease. Athma, unmanner them! To such a suggestion the one <br />
selfrespecting answer is to affirm that there are certain statements <br />
which ought not to be, and one should like to hope to be able to <br />
add, ought not to be allowed to be made. Nor have his detractors, <br />
who, an imperfectly warmblooded race, apparently conceive him <br />
as a great white caterpillar capable of any and every enormity in <br />
the calendar recorded to the discredit of the Juke and Kellikek <br />
families, mended their case by insinuating that, alternately, he lay <br />
at one time under the ludicrous imputation of annoying Welsh <br />
fusiliers in the people’s park. Hay, hay, hay! Hoq, hoq, hoq! <br />
Faun and Flora on the lea love that little old joq. To anyone who <br />
knew and loved the christlikeness of the big cleanminded giant <br />
H. C. Earwicker throughout his excellency long vicefreegal exis- <br />
tence the mere suggestion of him as a lustsleuth nosing for trou- <br />
ble in a boobytrap rings particularly preposterous. Truth, beard <br />
on prophet, compels one to add that there is said to have been <br />
quondam (pfuit! pfuit!) some case of the kind implicating, it is <br />
interdum believed, a quidam (if he did not exist it would be ne- <br />
cessary quoniam to invent him) abhout that time stambuling ha-<span></span></p>
