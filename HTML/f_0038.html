<p class="ni">occasion of the happy escape, for a crowning of pot valiance, <br />
this regional platter, benjamin of bouillis, with a spolish olive to <br />
middlepoint its zaynith, was marrying itself (porkograso!) ere- <br />
busqued very deluxiously with a bottle of Phenice-Bruerie ’98, <br />
followed for second nuptials by a Piessporter, Grand Cur, of <br />
both of which cherished tablelights (though humble the bounquet <br />
’tis a leaman’s farewell) he obdurately sniffed the cobwebcrusted <br />
corks.</p>

ear for spittoons (as the aftertale hath it) glaned up as usual with <br />
dumbestic husbandry (no persicks and armelians for thee, Pome- <br />
ranzia!) but, slipping the clav in her claw, broke of the matter <br />
among a hundred and eleven others in her usual curtsey (how <br />
faint these first vhespers womanly are, a secret pispigliando, amad <br />
the lavurdy den of their manfolker!) the next night nudge one <br />

cuppled lips and annie lawrie promises (mighshe never have <br />
Esnekerry pudden come Hunanov for her pecklapitschens!) that <br />
the gossiple so delivered in his epistolear, buried teatoastally in <br />
their Irish stew would go no further than his jesuit’s cloth, yet <br />
(in vinars venitas! volatiles valetotum!) it was this overspoiled <br />
priest Mr Browne, disguised as a vincentian, who, when seized <br />
of the facts, was overheard, in his secondary personality as a <br />
Nolan and underreared, poul soul, by accident<span class="em">—</span>if, that is, the <br />

strains of <em>The Secret of Her Birth</em>, hushly pierce the rubiend <br />
