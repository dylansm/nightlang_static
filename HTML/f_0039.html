<p class="ni">of his forties during a priestly flutter for safe and sane bets at the <br />
hippic runfields of breezy Baldoyle on a date (W. W. goes <br />
through the cald) easily capable of rememberance by all pickers- <br />
up of events national and Dublin details, the doubles of Perkin <br />
and Paullock, peer and prole, when the classic Encourage Hackney <br />
Plate was captured by two noses in a stablecloth finish, ek and nek, <br />
some and none, evelo nevelo, from the cream colt Bold Boy <br />
Cromwell after a clever getaway by Captain Chaplain Blount’s <br />
roe hinny Saint Dalough, Drummer Coxon, nondepict third, at <br />
breakneck odds, thanks to you great little, bonny little, portey <br />
little, Winny Widger! you’re all their nappies! who in his never- <br />
rip mud and purpular cap was surely leagues unlike any other <br />
phantomweight that ever toppitt our timber maggies.</p>

<p>’Twas two pisononse Timcoves (the wetter is pest, the renns are <br />
overt and come and the voax of the turfur is hurled on our lande) <br />
of the name of Treacle Tom as was just out of pop following the <br />
theft of a leg of Kehoe, Donnelly and Packenham’s Finnish pork <br />
and his own blood and milk brother Frisky Shorty, (he was, to be <br />
exquisitely punctilious about them, both shorty and frisky) a tip- <br />
ster, come off the hulks, both of them awful poor, what was out <br />
on the bumaround for an oofbird game for a jimmy o’goblin or <br />
a small thick un as chanced, while the Seaforths was making the <br />
colleenbawl, to ear the passon in the motor clobber make use of <br />
his law language (Edzo, Edzo on), touchin the case of Mr Adams <br />
what was in all the sundays about it which he was rubbing noses <br />
with and having a gurgle off his own along of the butty bloke in <br />
the specs.</p>

<p>This Treacle Tom to whom reference has been made had <br />
been absent from his usual wild and woolly haunts in the land <br />
of counties capalleens for some time previous to that (he was, in <br />
fact, in the habit of frequenting common lodginghouses where <br />
he slept in a nude state, hailfellow with meth, in strange men’s <br />
cots) but on racenight, blotto after divers tots of hell fire, red <br />
biddy, bull dog, blue ruin and creeping jenny, Eglandine’s choic- <br />
est herbage, supplied by the Duck and Doggies, the Galop- <br />
ping Primrose, Brigid Brewster’s, the Cock, the Postboy’s Horn,<span></span></p>
