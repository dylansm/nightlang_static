%ni%of his forties during a priestly flutter for safe and sane bets at the  
hippic runfields of breezy Baldoyle on a date (W. W. goes  
through the cald) easily capable of rememberance by all pickers-  
up of events national and Dublin details, the doubles of Perkin  
and Paullock, peer and prole, when the classic Encourage Hackney  
Plate was captured by two noses in a stablecloth finish, ek and nek,  
some and none, evelo nevelo, from the cream colt Bold Boy  
Cromwell after a clever getaway by Captain Chaplain Blount’s  
roe hinny Saint Dalough, Drummer Coxon, nondepict third, at  
breakneck odds, thanks to you great little, bonny little, portey

the specs.

This Treacle Tom to whom reference has been made had  
been absent from his usual wild and woolly haunts in the land  
of counties capalleens for some time previous to that (he was, in  
fact, in the habit of frequenting common lodginghouses where  
he slept in a nude state, hailfellow with meth, in strange men’s  
cots) but on racenight, blotto after divers tots of hell fire, red  
biddy, bull dog, blue ruin and creeping jenny, Eglandine’s choic-
