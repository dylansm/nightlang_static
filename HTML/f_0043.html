some wandering hamalags out of the adjacent cloverfields of <br />
Mosse’s Gardens, an oblate father from Skinner’s Alley, brick- <br />
layers, a fleming, in tabinet fumant, with spouse and dog, an aged <br />
hammersmith who had some chisellers by the hand, a bout of <br />
cudgel players, not a few sheep with the braxy, two bluecoat <br />
scholars, four broke gents out of Simpson’s on the Rocks, a <br />
portly and a pert still tassing Turkey Coffee and orange shrub in <br />
tickeyes door, Peter Pim and Paul Fry and then Elliot and, O, <br />
Atkinson, suffering hell’s delights from the blains of their annui- <br />
tants’ acorns not forgetting a deuce of dianas ridy for the hunt, a <br />
particularist prebendary pondering on the roman easter, the ton- <br />
sure question and greek uniates, plunk em, a lace lappet head or <br />
two or three or four from a window, and so on down to a few good <br />
old souls, who, as they were juiced after taking their pledge over at <br />
the uncle’s place, were evidently under the spell of liquor, from the <br />
wake of Tarry the Tailor a fair girl, a jolly postoboy thinking off <br />
three flagons and one, a plumodrole, a half sir from the weaver’s <br />
almshouse who clings and clings and chatchatchat clings to her, a <br />

a gaze) and the ballad, in the felibrine trancoped metre affectioned <br />
by Taiocebo in his <em>Casudas de Poulichinello Artahut</em>, stump- <br />
stampaded on to a slip of blancovide and headed by an excessively <br />
rough and red woodcut, privately printed at the rimepress of <br />
Delville, soon fluttered its secret on white highway and brown <br />
byway to the rose of the winds and the blew of the gaels, from <br />
archway to lattice and from black hand to pink ear, village crying <br />

in dirt! To the added strains (so peacifold) of his majesty the <br />
flute, that onecrooned king of inscrewments, Piggott’s purest, <em>ciello <br />
