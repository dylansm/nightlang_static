some wandering hamalags out of the adjacent cloverfields of  
Mosse’s Gardens, an oblate father from Skinner’s Alley, brick-  
layers, a fleming, in tabinet fumant, with spouse and dog, an aged  
hammersmith who had some chisellers by the hand, a bout of  
cudgel players, not a few sheep with the braxy, two bluecoat  
scholars, four broke gents out of Simpson’s on the Rocks, a  
portly and a pert still tassing Turkey Coffee and orange shrub in  
tickeyes door, Peter Pim and Paul Fry and then Elliot and, O,  
Atkinson, suffering hell’s delights from the blains of their annui-  
tants’ acorns not forgetting a deuce of dianas ridy for the hunt, a

rough and red woodcut, privately printed at the rimepress of  
Delville, soon fluttered its secret on white highway and brown  
byway to the rose of the winds and the blew of the gaels, from  
archway to lattice and from black hand to pink ear, village crying
