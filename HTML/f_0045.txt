%ni%Have you heard of one Humpty Dumpty  
How he fell with a roll and a rumble  
And curled up like Lord Olofa Crumple  
By the butt of the Magazine Wall,

%chorus%(Chorus) Of the Magazine Wall,  
Hump, helmet and all?

%ni stanza%He was one time our King of the Castle  
Now he’s kicked about like a rotten old parsnip.  
And from Green street he’ll be sent by order of His Worship  
To the penal jail of Mountjoy

%chorus%(Chorus) To the jail of Mountjoy!  
Jail him and joy.

%ni stanza%He was fafafather of all schemes for to bother us  
Slow coaches and immaculate contraceptives for the populace,  
Mare’s milk for the sick, seven dry Sundays a week,  
Openair love and religion’s reform,

%chorus%(Chorus) And religious reform,  
Hideous in form.

%ni stanza%Arrah, why, says you, couldn’t he manage it?  
I’ll go bail, my fine dairyman darling,  
Like the bumping bull of the Cassidys  
All your butter is in your horns.

%chorus%(Chorus) His butter is in his horns.  
Butter his horns!

%ni stanza%(Repeat) Hurrah there, Hosty, frosty Hosty, change that shirt on ye,  
Rhyme the rann, the king of all ranns!

%c%*Balbaccio, balbuccio!*

%ni stanza%We had chaw chaw chops, chairs, chewing gum, the chickenpox and china chambers  
Universally provided by this soffsoaping salesman.%j%
