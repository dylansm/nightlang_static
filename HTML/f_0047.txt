For to go and shove himself that way on top of her.

Of our antediluvial zoo,

Our rotorious hippopopotamuns

Give him six years.

But look out for his missus legitimate!

The largest ever you seen.

Along with the devil and Danes,

And all their remains.

Will resurrect his corpus  
For there’s no true spell in Connacht or hell

%chorus%(bis) That’s able to raise a Cain.
