still after his curtain’s doom’s doom. <em>Ei fù.</em> His husband, poor old <br />
A’Hara (Okaroff?) crestfallen by things and down at heels at the <br />
time, they squeak, accepted the (Zassnoch!) ardree’s shilling at <br />
the conclusion of the Crimean war and, having flown his wild <br />
geese, alohned in crowds to warnder on like Shuley Luney, <br />
enlisted in Tyrone’s horse, the Irish whites, and soldiered a bit <br />

at a word from Israfel the Summoner, passed away painlessly <br />
after life’s upsomdowns one hallowe’en night, ebbrous and in <br />
the state of nature, propelled from Behind into the great Beyond <br />
by footblows coulinclouted upon his oyster and atlas on behanged <br />
and behooved and behicked and behulked of his last fishandblood <br />
