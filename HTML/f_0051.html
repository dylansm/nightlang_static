<p class="ni">the average human cloudyphiz, whereas sallow has long daze <br />
faded, frequently altered its ego with the possing of the showers <br />
(Not original!). Whence it is a slopperish matter, given the wet <br />
and low visibility (since in this scherzarade of one’s thousand one <br />
