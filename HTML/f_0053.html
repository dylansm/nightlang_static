<p class="ni">a fin fell. Boomster rombombonant! It scenes like a landescape <br />
from Wildu Picturescu or some seem on some dimb Arras, dumb <br />

kristansen is odable to os across the wineless Ere no œdor nor <br />

<p>And there oftafter, jauntyjogging, on an Irish visavis, instea- <br />
dily with shoulder to shoulder Jehu will tell to Christianier, saint <br />
to sage, the humphriad of that fall and rise while daisy winks at <br />
her pinker sister among the tussocks and the copoll between the <br />
shafts mocks the couple on the car. And as your who may look <br />

petrusu</em>. The augustan peacebetothem oaks, the monolith rising <br />
stark from the moonlit pinebarren. In all fortitudinous ajaxious <br />
rowdinoisy tenuacity. The angelus hour with ditchers bent upon <br />
their farm usetensiles, the soft belling of the fallow deers (<em>doereh- <br />
moose genuane!</em>) advertising their milky approach as midnight <br />
was striking the hours (<em>letate!</em>), and how brightly the great tri- <br />

Lorenzo Tooley street and how he wished his Honour the ban- <br />
