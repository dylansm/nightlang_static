<p class="ni">scenities, una mona. Sylvia Silence, the girl detective (<em>Meminerva</em>, <br />
but by now one hears turtlings all over Doveland!) when supplied <br />
with informations as to the several facets of the case in her cozy- <br />
dozy bachelure’s flat, quite overlooking John a’Dream’s mews, <br />
leaned back in her really truly easy chair to query restfully through <br />
her vowelthreaded syllabelles: Have you evew thought, wepow- <br />
tew, that sheew gweatness was his twadgedy? Nevewtheless ac- <br />
cowding to my considewed attitudes fow this act he should pay <br />
the full penalty, pending puwsuance, as pew Subsec. 32, section <br />
11, of the C. L. A. act 1885, anything in this act to the contwawy <br />
notwithstanding. Jarley Jilke began to silke for he couldn’t get <br />
home to Jelsey but ended with: He’s got the sack that helped him <br />
moult instench of his gladsome rags. Meagher, a naval rating, <br />
seated on one of the granite cromlech setts of our new fish- <br />
shambles for the usual aireating after the ever popular act, with <br />
whom were Questa and Puella, piquante and quoite, (this had a <br />
cold in her brain while that felt a sink in her summock, wit’s <br />
wat, wot’s wet) was encouraged, although nearvanashed himself, <br />
by one of his co-affianced to get your breath, Walt, and gobbit <br />
and when ther chidden by her fastra sastra to saddle up your <br />
pance, Naville, thus cor replied to her other’s thankskissing: I <br />
lay my two fingerbuttons, fiancee Meagher, (he speaks!) he was <br />
to blame about your two velvetthighs up Horniman’s Hill<span class="em">—</span>as <br />
hook and eye blame him or any other piscman?<span class="em">—</span>but I also <br />
think, Puellywally, by the siege of his trousers there was some- <br />
one else behind it<span class="em">—</span>you bet your boughtem blarneys<span class="em">—</span>about <br />
their three drummers down Keysars Lane. (Trite!).</p>

<p>Be these meer marchant taylor’s fablings of a race referend <br />
with oddman rex? Is now all seenheard then forgotten? Can it <br />
was, one is fain in this leaden age of letters now to wit, that so <br />
diversified outrages (they have still to come!) were planned and <br />
partly carried out against so staunch a covenanter if it be true <br />
than any of those recorded ever took place for many, we trow, <br />
beyessed to and denayed of, are given to us by some who use <br />
the truth but sparingly and we, on this side ought to sorrow for <br />
their pricking pens on that account. The seventh city, Urovivla,<span></span></p>
