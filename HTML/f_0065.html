<p class="ni">they’re raised on bruised stone root ginger though it winters on <br />
their heads as if auctumned round their waistbands. If you’d had <br />
pains in your hairs you wouldn’t look so orgibald. You’d have <br />
Colley Macaires on your lump of lead. Now listen, Mr Leer! <br />
And stow that sweatyfunnyadams Simper! Take an old geeser <br />
who calls on his skirt. Note his sleek hair, so elegant, <em>tableau <br />
vivant</em>. He vows her to be his own honeylamb, swears they will <br />
be papa pals, by Sam, and share good times way down west in a <br />
guaranteed happy lovenest when May moon she shines and they <br />
twit twinkle all the night, combing the comet’s tail up right and <br />
shooting popguns at the stars. Creampuffs all to dime! Every <br />
nice, missymackenzies! For dear old grumpapar, he’s gone on <br />
the razzledar, through gazing and crazing and blazing at the stars. <br />
Compree! She wants her wardrobe to hear from above by return <br />
with cash so as she can buy her Peter Robinson trousseau and cut <br />
a dash with Arty, Bert or possibly Charley Chance (who knows?) <br />
so tolloll Mr Hunker you’re too dada for me to dance (so off she <br />
goes!) and that’s how half the gels in town has got their bottom <br />
drars while grumpapar he’s trying to hitch his braces on to his <br />
trars. But old grum he’s not so clean dippy between sweet you <br />
and yum (not on your life, boy! not in those trousers! not by a <br />
large jugful!) for someplace on the sly, where Furphy he isn’t by, <br />
old grum has his gel number two (bravevow, our Grum!) and he <br />
would like to canoodle her too some part of the time for he is <br />
downright fond of his number one but O he’s fair mashed on <br />
peaches number two so that if he could only canoodle the two, <br />
chivee chivoo, all three would feel genuinely happy, it’s as simple <br />
as A. B. C., the two mixers, we mean, with their cherrybum <br />
chappy (for he is simply shamming dippy) if they all were afloat <br />
in a dreamlifeboat, hugging two by two in his zoo-doo-you-doo, <br />
a tofftoff for thee, missymissy for me and howcameyou-e’enso for <br />
Farber, in his tippy, upindown dippy, tiptoptippy canoodle, can <br />
you? Finny.</p>

<p>Ack, ack, ack. With which clap, trap and soddenment, three to <br />
a loaf, our mutual friends the fender and the bottle at the gate seem <br />
to be implicitly in the same bateau, so to singen, bearing also</p>
