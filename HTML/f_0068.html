<p class="ni">one day while dodging chores that she stripped teasily for binocu- <br />
lar man and that her jambs were jimpjoyed to see each other, the <br />
nautchy girly soon found her fruitful hat too small for her and <br />
rapidly taking time, look, she rapidly took to necking, partying <br />
and selling her spare favours in the haymow or in lumber closets <br />
or in the greenawn ad huck (there are certain intimacies in all <br />
ladies’ lavastories we just lease to imagination) or in the sweet <br />
churchyard close itself for a bit of soft coal or an array of thin <br />
trunks, serving whom in fine that same hot coney a la Zingara <br />
which our own little Graunya of the chilired cheeks dished up <br />
to the greatsire of Oscar, that son of a Coole. Houri of the coast <br />
of emerald, arrah of the lacessive poghue, Aslim-all-Muslim, the <br />
resigned to her surrender, did not she, come leinster’s even, true <br />
dotter of a dearmud, (her pitch was Forty Steps and his perch old <br />
Cromwell’s Quarters) with so valkirry a licence as sent many a <br />

robed, exalted be his glory! So gave so take: Now not, not now! <br />
He would just a min. Suffering trumpet! He thought he want. <br />
Whath? Hear, O hear, living of the land! Hungreb, dead era, <br />

profit, he cannot answer. Upterputty till rise and shine! Nor needs <br />
none shaft ne stele from Phenicia or Little Asia to obelise on <br />
the spout, neither pobalclock neither folksstone, nor sunkenness <br />
in Tomar’s Wood to bewray how erpressgangs score off the rued. <br />
The mouth that tells not will ever attract the unthinking tongue <br />
and so long as the obseen draws theirs which hear not so long <br />
