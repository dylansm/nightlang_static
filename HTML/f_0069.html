<p class="ni">not, has been the expression, direct or through an agent male, of <br />
womanhid offended, (ah! ah!), has not levy of black mail from <br />
the times the fairies were in it, and fain for wilde erthe blothoms <br />
followed an impressive private reputation for whispered sins?</p>

<p>Now by memory inspired, turn wheel again to the whole of <br />
the wall. Where Gyant Blyant fronts Peannlueamoore There was <br />
once upon a wall and a hooghoog wall a was and such a wall- <br />
hole did exist. Ere ore or ire in Aaarlund. Or you Dair’s Hair or <br />
you Diggin Mosses or your horde of orts and oriorts to garble <br />
a garthen of Odin and the lost paladays when all the eddams ended <br />
with aves. Armen? The doun is theirs and still to see for menags <br />
if he strikes a lousaforitch and we’ll come to those baregazed <br />
shoeshines if you just shoodov a second. And let oggs be good <br />
old gaggles and Isther Estarr play Yesther Asterr. In the drema <br />
of Sorestost Areas, Diseased. A stonehinged gate then was for <br />
another thing while the suroptimist had bought and enlarged <br />
that shack under fair rental of one yearlyng sheep, (prime) value <br />
of sixpence, and one small yearlyng goat (cadet) value of eight- <br />
pence, to grow old and happy (hogg it and kidd him) for the re- <br />
minants of his years; and when everything was got up for the <br />
purpose he put an applegate on the place by no means as some <br />
pretext a bedstead in loo thereof to keep out donkeys (the pig- <br />
dirt hanging from the jags to this hour makes that clear) and just <br />
thenabouts the iron gape, by old custom left open to prevent <br />
the cats from getting at the gout, was triplepatlockt on him on <br />
purpose by his faithful poorters to keep him inside probably and <br />
possibly enaunter he felt like sticking out his chest too far and <br />
tempting gracious providence by a stroll on the peoplade’s egg- <br />
day, unused as he was yet to being freely clodded.</p>

<p>O, by the by, lets wee brag of praties, it ought to be always <br />
remembered in connection with what has gone before that there <br />
was a northroomer, Herr Betreffender, out for his zimmer hole- <br />
digs, digging in number 32 at the Rum and Puncheon (Branch of <br />
Dirty Dick’s free house) in Laxlip (where the Sockeye Sammons <br />
were stopping at the time orange fasting) prior to that, a Kom- <br />
merzial (Gorbotipacco, he was wreaking like Zentral Oylrubber)</p>
