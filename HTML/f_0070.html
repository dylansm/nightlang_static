<p class="ni">from Osterich, the U.S.E. paying (Gaul save the mark!) 11/- in <br />
the week (Gosh, these wholly romads!) of conscience money in <br />
the first deal of Yuly wheil he was, swishing beesnest with bles- <br />

Now you must know, franksman, to make a heart of glass, that <br />
the game of gaze and bandstand butchery was merely a Patsy <br />
O’Strap tissue of threats and obuses such as roebucks raugh at <br />
pinnacle’s peak and after this sort. Humphrey’s unsolicited visitor, <br />
Davy or Titus, on a burgley’s clan march from the middle west, <br />

stirabouter, that he would give him his (or theumperom’s or any- <br />

pitch in with, alleging that his granfather’s was all taxis and that <br />
it was only after ten o’connell, and this his isbar was a public <br />
oven for the sake of irsk irskusky, and then, not easily dis- <br />
