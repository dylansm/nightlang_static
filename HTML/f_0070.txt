the week (Gosh, these wholly romads!) of conscience money in  
the first deal of Yuly wheil he was, swishing beesnest with bles-

Now you must know, franksman, to make a heart of glass, that  
the game of gaze and bandstand butchery was merely a Patsy  
O’Strap tissue of threats and obuses such as roebucks raugh at  
pinnacle’s peak and after this sort. Humphrey’s unsolicited visitor,  
Davy or Titus, on a burgley’s clan march from the middle west,

Mountains like a starling bierd, after doing a long dance untidled  
to Cloudy Green, deposend his bockstump on the waityoumay-

it was only after ten o’connell, and this his isbar was a public

couraged, opened the wrathfloods of his atillarery and went on at  
a wicked rate, weathering against him in mooxed metaphores  
from eleven thirty to two in the afternoon without even a lunch-  
eonette interval for House, son of Clod, to come out, you jew-  
beggar, to be Executed Amen. Earwicker, that patternmind, that
