<p class="ni">there being no macadamised sidetracks on those old nekropolitan <br />
nights in, barring a footbatter, Bryant’s Causeway, bordered <br />
with speedwell, white clover and sorrel a wood knows, which <br />
left off, being beaten, where the plaintiff was struck, she <br />
left down, as scavengers, who will be scavengers must, her <br />
filthdump near the Serpentine in Phornix Park (at her time called <br />
Finewell’s Keepsacre but later tautaubapptossed Pat’s Purge), <br />
that dangerfield circling butcherswood where fireworker oh <br />
flaherty engaged a nutter of castlemallards and ah for archer <br />
stunned’s turk, all over which fossil footprints, bootmarks, <br />
fingersigns, elbowdints, breechbowls, a. s. o. were all succes- <br />
sively traced of a most envolving description. What subtler <br />
timeplace of the weald than such wolfsbelly castrament to will <br />
hide a leabhar from Thursmen’s brandihands or a loveletter, <br />
lostfully hers, that would be lust on Ma, than then when ructions <br />
ended, than here where race began: and by four hands of fore- <br />
thought the first babe of reconcilement is laid in its last cradle <br />
of hume sweet hume. Give over it! And no more of it! So pass <br />
the pick for child sake! O men!</p>

<p>For hear Allhighest sprack for krischnians as for propagana <br />
fidies and his nuptial eagles sharped their beaks of prey: and <br />
every morphyl man of us, pome by pome, falls back into this <br />
terrine: as it was let it be, says he! And it is as though where <br />
Agni araflammed and Mithra monished and Shiva slew as maya- <br />
mutras the obluvial waters of our noarchic memory withdrew, <br />
windingly goharksome, to some hastyswasty timberman torch- <br />
priest, flamenfan, the ward of the wind that lightened the fire that <br />
lay in the wood that Jove bolt, at his rude word. Posidonius <br />
O’Fluctuary! Lave that bloody stone as it is! What are you <br />
doing your dirty minx and his big treeblock way up your path? <br />
Slip around, you, by the rare of the ministers’! And, you, take <br />
that barrel back where you got it, Mac Shane’s, and go the way <br />
your old one went, Hatchettsbury Road! And gish! how they <br />
gushed away, the pennyfares, a whole school for scamper, with <br />
their sashes flying sish behind them, all the little pirlypettes! <br />
Issy-la-Chapelle! Any lucans, please?</p>
