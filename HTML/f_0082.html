was carrying the worm (a handy term for the portable distillery <br />
which consisted of three vats, two jars and several bottles though <br />
we purposely say nothing of the stiff, both parties having an <br />
interest in the spirits): Let me go, Pautheen! I hardly knew ye. <br />
Later on, after the solstitial pause for refleshmeant, the same <br />
