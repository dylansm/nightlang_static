<p class="ni">their standing verdict of Nolans Brumans whereoneafter King, <br />
having murdered all the English he knew, picked out his pockets <br />
and left the tribunal scotfree, trailing his Tommeylommey’s tunic <br />
in his hurry, thereinunder proudly showing off the blink patch to <br />
his britgits to prove himself (an’t plase yous!) a rael genteel. To <br />
the Switz bobbyguard’s curial but courtlike: Commodore valley O <br />
hairy, Arthre jennyrosy?: the firewaterloover returted with such a <br />
vinesmelling fortytudor ages rawdownhams tanyouhide as would <br />
the latten stomach even of a tumass equinous (we were prepared <br />
for the chap’s clap cap, the accent, but, took us as, by surprise <br />
and now we’re geshing it like gush gash from a burner!) so that all <br />
the twofromthirty advocatesses within echo, pulling up their briefs <br />
at the krigkry: Shun the Punman!: safely and soundly soccered <br />
that fenemine Parish Poser, (how dare he!) umprumptu right- <br />
oway hames, much to his thanks, gratiasagam, to all the wrong <br />
donatrices, biss Drinkbattle’s Dingy Dwellings where (for like <br />
your true venuson Esau he was dovetimid as the dears at <br />
Bottome) he shat in (zoo), like the muddy goalbind who he was <br />
(dun), the chassetitties belles conclaiming: You and your gift of <br />
your gaft of your garbage abaht our Farvver! and gaingridando: <br />
Hon! Verg! Nau! Putor! Skam! Schams! Shames!</p>

<p>And so it all ended. Artha kama dharma moksa. Ask Kavya for <br />
the kay. And so everybody heard their plaint and all listened to <br />
their plause. The letter! The litter! And the soother the bitther! <br />
Of eyebrow pencilled, by lipstipple penned. Borrowing a word <br />
and begging the question and stealing tinder and slipping like <br />
soap. From dark Rasa Lane a sigh and a weep, from Lesbia <br />
Looshe the beam in her eye, from lone Coogan Barry his arrow <br />
of song, from Sean Kelly’s anagrim a blush at the name, from <br />
I am the Sullivan that trumpeting tramp, from Suffering Duf- <br />
ferin the Sit of her Style, from Kathleen May Vernon her Mebbe <br />
fair efforts, from Fillthepot Curran his scotchlove machree- <br />
ther, from hymn Op. 2 Phil Adolphos the weary O, the leery, <br />
O, from Samyouwill Leaver or Damyouwell Lover thatjolly <br />
old molly bit or that bored saunter by, from Timm Finn again’s <br />
weak tribes, loss of strenghth to his sowheel, from the wedding<span></span></p>
