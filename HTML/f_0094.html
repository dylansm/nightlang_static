<p class="ni">on the greene, agirlies, the gretnass of joyboys, from Pat Mullen, <br />
Tom Mallon, Dan Meldon, Don Maldon a slickstick picnic made <br />
in Moate by Muldoons. The solid man saved by his sillied woman. <br />
Crackajolking away like a hearse on fire. The elm that whimpers <br />
at the top told the stone that moans when stricken. Wind broke <br />
it. Wave bore it. Reed wrote of it. Syce ran with it. Hand tore <br />
it and wild went war. Hen trieved it and plight pledged peace. <br />
It was folded with cunning, sealed with crime, uptied by a harlot, <br />
undone by a child. It was life but was it fair? It was free but was <br />
it art? The old hunks on the hill read it to perlection. It made <br />
ma make merry and sissy so shy and rubbed some shine off Shem <br />
and put some shame into Shaun. Yet Una and Ita spill famine <br />
with drought and Agrippa, the propastored, spells tripulations <br />
in his threne. Ah, furchte fruchte, timid Danaides! Ena milo melo- <br />
mon, frai is frau and swee is too, swee is two when swoo is free, <br />
ana mala woe is we! A pair of sycopanties with amygdaleine <br />
eyes, one old obster lumpky pumpkin and three meddlars on <br />
their slies. And that was how framm Sin fromm Son, acity arose, <br />
finfin funfun, a sitting arrows. Now tell me, tell me, tell me then!</p>

<p>What was it?</p>

<p>So there you are now there they were, when all was over <br />
again, the four with them, setting around upin their judges’ <br />
chambers, in the muniment room, of their marshalsea, under the <br />
suspices of Lally, around their old traditional tables of the law <br />
like Somany Solans to talk it over rallthesameagain. Well and <br />
druly dry. Suffering law the dring. Accourting to king’s evelyns. <br />
So help her goat and kiss the bouc. Festives and highajinks and <br />
jintyaun and her beetyrossy bettydoaty and not to forget now <br />
a’duna o’darnel. The four of them and thank court now there <br />
were no more of them. So pass the push for port sake. Be it soon. <br />
Ah ho! And do you remember, Singabob, the badfather, the <br />
same, the great Howdoyoucallem, and his old nickname, Dirty <br />
Daddy Pantaloons, in his monopoleums, behind the war of the <br />
two roses, with Michael Victory, the sheemen’s preester, before<span></span></p>
