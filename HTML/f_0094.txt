%ni%on the greene, agirlies, the gretnass of joyboys, from Pat Mullen,  
Tom Mallon, Dan Meldon, Don Maldon a slickstick picnic made  
in Moate by Muldoons. The solid man saved by his sillied woman.  
Crackajolking away like a hearse on fire. The elm that whimpers  
at the top told the stone that moans when stricken. Wind broke  
it. Wave bore it. Reed wrote of it. Syce ran with it. Hand tore  
it and wild went war. Hen trieved it and plight pledged peace.  
It was folded with cunning, sealed with crime, uptied by a harlot,  
undone by a child. It was life but was it fair? It was free but was  
it art? The old hunks on the hill read it to perlection. It made  
ma make merry and sissy so shy and rubbed some shine off Shem  
and put some shame into Shaun. Yet Una and Ita spill famine  
with drought and Agrippa, the propastored, spells tripulations  
in his threne. Ah, furchte fruchte, timid Danaides! Ena milo melo-  
mon, frai is frau and swee is too, swee is two when swoo is free,

finfin funfun, a sitting arrows. Now tell me, tell me, tell me then!

So there you are now there they were, when all was over  
again, the four with them, setting around upin their judges’  
chambers, in the muniment room, of their marshalsea, under the  
suspices of Lally, around their old traditional tables of the law  
like Somany Solans to talk it over rallthesameagain. Well and  
druly dry. Suffering law the dring. Accourting to king’s evelyns.  
So help her goat and kiss the bouc. Festives and highajinks and  
jintyaun and her beetyrossy bettydoaty and not to forget now  
a’duna o’darnel. The four of them and thank court now there  
were no more of them. So pass the push for port sake. Be it soon.  
Ah ho! And do you remember, Singabob, the badfather, the  
same, the great Howdoyoucallem, and his old nickname, Dirty  
Daddy Pantaloons, in his monopoleums, behind the war of the
