Minster York? Do I mind? I mind the gush off the mon like Bal- <br />
lybock manure works on a tradewinds day. And the O’Moyly <br />
gracies and the O’Briny rossies chaffing him bluchface and play- <br />

putting out her netherlights, and I’d sooner one precious sip at <br />
your pure mountain dew than enrich my acquaintance with that <br />
