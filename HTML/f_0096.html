<p class="ni">ing jackass. Harik! Harik! Harik! The rose is white in the darik! <br />
And Sunfella’s nose has got rhinoceritis from haunting the roes <br />
in the parik! So all rogues lean to rhyme. And contradrinking <br />
themselves about Lillytrilly law pon hilly and Mrs Niall of the <br />
Nine Corsages and the old markiss their besterfar, and, arrah, <br />
sure there was never a marcus at all at all among the manlies and <br />
dear Sir Armoury, queer Sir Rumoury, and the old house by the <br />
churpelizod, and all the goings on so very wrong long before <br />
when they were going on retreat, in the old gammeldags, the <br />
four of them, in Milton’s Park under lovely Father Whisperer <br />
and making her love with his stuffstuff in the languish of flowers <br />
and feeling to find was she mushymushy, and wasn’t that vely <br />

loll Lolly! To give and to take! And to forego the pasht! And <br />
all will be forgotten! Ah ho! It was too too bad to be falling <br />
out about her kindness pet and the shape of OOOOOOOO <br />
Ourang’s time. Well, all right, Lelly. And shakeahand. And <br />
schenkusmore. For Craig sake. Be it suck.</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p>Well, even should not the framing up of such figments in the <br />
evidential order bring the true truth to light as fortuitously as <br />
a dim seer’s setting of a starchart might (heaven helping it!) un- <br />
cover the nakedness of an unknown body in the fields of blue <br />
or as forehearingly as the sibspeeches of all mankind have foli- <br />
ated (earth seizing them!) from the root of some funner’s stotter <br />
all the soundest sense to be found immense our special mentalists <br />
now holds (<em>securus iudicat orbis terrarum</em>) that by such playing <br />
