<p class="ni">beetly dead whether by land whither by water. Transocean <br />
atalaclamoured him; The latter! The latter! Shall their hope then <br />
be silent or Macfarlane lack of lamentation? He lay under leagues <br />

<p>But, their bright little contemporaries notwithstanding, on <br />
the morrowing morn of the suicidal murder of the unrescued ex- <br />
patriate, aslike as asnake comes sliduant down that oaktree onto <br />
the duke of beavers, (you may have seen some liquidamber exude <br />
exotic from a balsam poplar at Parteen-a-lax Limestone. Road <br />
and cried Abies Magnifica! not, noble fir?) a quarter of nine, <br />
imploring his resipiency, saw the infallible spike of smoke’s jutstiff <br />
punctual from the seventh gable of our Quintus Centimachus’ <br />
porphyroid buttertower and then thirsty p.m. with oaths upon <br />
his lastingness (<em>En caecos harauspices! Annos longos patimur!</em>) the <br />
lamps of maintenance, beaconsfarafield innerhalf the zuggurat, all <br />

swinglowswaying bluepaw, the outstanding man, the lolllike lady, <br />
being litten for the long (O land, how long!) lifesnight, with <br />
suffusion of fineglass transom and leadlight panes.</p>

<p>Wherefore let it hardly by any being thinking be said either or <br />
thought that the prisoner of that sacred edifice, were he an Ivor <br />
the Boneless or an Olaf the Hide, was at his best a onestone par- <br />
able, a rude breathing on the void of to be, a venter hearing his <br />
own bauchspeech in backwords, or, more strictly, but tristurned <br />
initials, the cluekey to a worldroom beyond the roomwhorld, for <br />
scarce one, or pathetically few of his dode canal sammenlivers <br />
cared seriously or for long to doubt with Kurt Iuld van Dijke <br />
(the gravitational pull perceived by certain fixed residents and <br />
the capture of uncertain comets chancedrifting through our sys- <br />
tem suggesting an authenticitatem of his aliquitudinis) the canoni- <br />
city of his existence as a tesseract. Be still, O quick! Speak him <br />
