<p class="ni stanza indent-4"><em>At Island Bridge she met her tide. <br />
Attabom, attabom, attabombomboom! <br />
The Fin had a flux and his Ebba a ride. <br />
Attabom, attabom, attabombomboom! <br />

have hanged our hearts in her trees; and we list, as she bibs us,  
by the waters of babalong.
