<p class="ni"><em>White So ts My Washing Done by Night, First and Last Only <br />
True Account au about the Honorary Mirsu Earwicker, L.S.D., <br />
and the Snake (Nuggets!) by a Woman of the World who only can <br />
Tell Naked Truths about a Dear Man and all his Conspirators how <br />
they all Tried to Fall him Putting it all around Lucalizod about <br />
Privates Earwicker and a Pair of Sloppy Sluts plainly Showing all <br />
the Unmentionability falsely Accusing about the Raincoats.</em></p>

<p>The proteiform graph itself is a polyhedron of scripture. <br />
There was a time when naif alphabetters would have written it <br />
down the tracing of a purely deliquescent recidivist, possibly <br />
ambidextrous, snubnosed probably and presenting a strangely <br />
profound rainbowl in his (or her) occiput. To the hardily curio- <br />
sing entomophilust then it has shown a very sexmosaic of nym- <br />
phosis in which the eternal chimerahunter Oriolopos, now frond <br />
of sugars, then lief of saults, the sensory crowd in his belly <br />
coupled with an eye for the goods trooth bewilderblissed by <br />
their night effluvia with guns like drums and fondlers like forceps <br />
persequestellates his vanessas from flore to flore. Somehows this <br />
sounds like the purest kidooleyoon wherein our madernacerution <br />
of lour lore is rich. All’s so herou from us him in a kitchernott <br />
darkness, by hasard and worn rolls arered, we must grope on till <br />
Zerogh hour like pou owl giaours as we are would we salve aught <br />
of moments for our aysore today. Amousin though not but. Closer <br />
inspection of the <em>bordereau</em> would reveal a multiplicity of person- <br />
alities inflicted on the documents or document and some prevision <br />
of virtual crime or crimes might be made by anyone unwary <br />
enough before any suitable occasion for it or them had so far <br />
managed to happen along. In fact, under the closed eyes of the in- <br />
spectors the traits featuring the <em>chiaroscuro</em> coalesce, their con- <br />
trarieties eliminated, in one stable somebody similarly as by the <br />
providential warring of heartshaker with housebreaker and of <br />
dramdrinker against freethinker our social something bowls along <br />
bumpily, experiencing a jolting series of prearranged disappoint- <br />
ments, down the long lane of (it’s as semper as oxhousehumper!) <br />
generations, more generations and still more generations.</p>
