<p class="ni">anyhow? Erect, beseated, mountback, against a partywall, below <br />
freezigrade, by the use of quill or style, with turbid or pellucid <br />
mind, accompanied or the reverse by mastication, interrupted <br />
by visit of seer to scribe or of scribe to site, atwixt two showers <br />
or atosst of a trike, rained upon or blown around, by a right- <br />
down regular racer from the soil or by a too pained whittlewit <br />
laden with the loot of learning?</p>

<p>Now, patience; and remember patience is the great thing, and <br />
above all things else we must avoid anything like being or be- <br />
coming out of patience. A good plan used by worried business <br />
folk who may not have had many momentums to master Kung’s <br />
doctrine of the meang or the propriety codestruces of Carpri- <br />
mustimus is just to think of all the sinking fund of patience pos- <br />
sessed in their conjoint names by both brothers Bruce with whom <br />
are incorporated their Scotch spider and Elberfeld’s Calculating <br />
Horses. If after years upon years of delving in ditches dark one <br />
tubthumper more than others, Kinihoun or Kahanan, giardarner <br />
or mear measenmanonger, has got up for the darnall same pur- <br />
pose of reassuring us with all the barbar of the Carrageehouse <br />
that our great ascendant was properly speaking three syllables <br />
less than his own surname (yes, yes, less!), that the ear of Fionn <br />
Earwicker aforetime was the trademark of a broadcaster with <br />
wicker local jargon for an ace’s patent (Hear! Calls! Everywhair!) <br />
then as to this radiooscillating epiepistle to which, cotton, silk or <br />
samite, kohol, gall or brickdust, we must ceaselessly return, where- <br />
abouts exactly at present in Siam, Hell or Tophet under that <br />
glorisol which plays touraloup with us in this Aludin’s Cove of <br />
our cagacity is that bright soandsuch to slip us the dinkum oil?</p>

<p>Naysayers we know. To conclude purely negatively from the <br />
positive absence of political odia and monetary requests that its <br />
page cannot ever have been a penproduct of a man or woman of <br />
that period or those parts is only one more unlookedfor conclu- <br />
sion leaped at, being tantamount to inferring from the nonpre- <br />
sence of inverted commas (sometimes called quotation marks) <br />
on any page that its author was always constitutionally incapable <br />
of misappropriating the spoken words of others.</p>
