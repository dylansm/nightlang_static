all its featureful perfection of imperfection, is its fortune: it ex- <br />

even the psychological content of any document to the sore <br />
neglect of the enveloping facts themselves circumstantiating it is <br />
just as hurtful to sound sense (and let it be added to the truest <br />
taste) as were some fellow in the act of perhaps getting an intro <br />

elaborative antecistral ceremony of upstheres, straightaway to run <br />

of local colour and personal perfume and suggestive, too, of so <br />
very much more and capable of being stretched, filled out, if need <br />

an expert, don’t you know? Who in his heart doubts either that <br />
the facts of feminine clothiering are there all the time or that the <br />
feminine fiction, stranger than the facts, is there also at the same <br />
time, only a little to the rere? Or that one may be separated from <br />
the other? Or that both may then be contemplated simultaneously? <br />
Or that each may be taken up and considered in turn apart from <br />
the other?</p>
