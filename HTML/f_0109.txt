Luckily there is another cant to the questy. Has any fellow, of  
the dime a dozen type, it might with some profit some dull even-

chested fortyish, faintly flatulent and given to ratiocination by  
syncopation in the elucidation of complications, of his greatest

ever looked sufficiently longly at a quite everydaylooking stamped  
addressed envelope? Admittedly it is an outer husk: its face, in  
all its featureful perfection of imperfection, is its fortune: it ex-

even the psychological content of any document to the sore  
neglect of the enveloping facts themselves circumstantiating it is  
just as hurtful to sound sense (and let it be added to the truest  
taste) as were some fellow in the act of perhaps getting an intro  
from another fellow turning out to be a friend in need of his, say,

the facts of feminine clothiering are there all the time or that the  
feminine fiction, stranger than the facts, is there also at the same  
time, only a little to the rere? Or that one may be separated from  
the other? Or that both may then be contemplated simultaneously?  
Or that each may be taken up and considered in turn apart from  
the other?
