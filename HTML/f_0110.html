<p>Here let a few artifacts fend in their own favour. The river felt <br />
she wanted salt. That was just where Brien came in. The country <br />
asked for bearspaw for dindin! And boundin aboundin it got it <br />
surly. We who live under heaven, we of the clovery kingdom, <br />
we middlesins people have often watched the sky overreaching <br />
the land. We suddenly have. Our isle is Sainge. The place. That <br />
stern chuckler Mayhappy Mayhapnot, once said to repeation <br />
in that lutran conservatory way of his that Isitachapel-Asitalukin <br />
was the one place, <em>ult aut nult</em>, in this madh vaal of tares (whose <br />
verdhure’s yellowed therever Phaiton parks his car while its <br />
tamelised tay is the drame of Drainophilias) where the possible <br />
was the improbable and the improbable the inevitable. If the pro- <br />
verbial bishop of our holy and undivided with this me ken or no <br />
me ken Zot is the Quiztune havvermashed had his twoe nails <br />
on the head we are in for a sequentiality of improbable possibles <br />
though possibly nobody after having grubbed up a lock of cwold <br />

his remark for utterly impossible as are all these events they are <br />
probably as like those which may have taken place as any others <br />
which never took person at all are ever likely to be. Ahahn!</p>

<p>About that original hen. Midwinter (fruur or kuur?) was in the <br />
offing and Premver a promise of a pril when, as kischabrigies sang <br />
life’s old sahatsong, an iceclad shiverer, merest of bantlings ob- <br />
served a cold fowl behaviourising strangely on that fatal midden <br />
or chip factory or comicalbottomed copsjute (dump for short) <br />
afterwards changed into the orangery when in the course of <br />
deeper demolition unexpectedly one bushman’s holiday its limon <br />
threw up a few spontaneous fragments of orangepeel, the last <br />
remains of an outdoor meal by some unknown sunseeker or place- <br />
hider illico way back in his mistridden past. What child of a strand- <br />
looper but keepy little Kevin in the despondful surrounding of <br />
such sneezing cold would ever have trouved up on a strate that <br />
was called strete a motive for future saintity by euchring the <br />
finding of the Ardagh chalice by another heily innocent and <br />
beachwalker whilst trying with pious clamour to wheedle Tip-<span></span></p>
