<p class="ni">the farther back we manage to wiggle the more we need the loan <br />
of a lens to see as much as the hen saw. Tip.</p>

<p>You is feeling like you was lost in the bush, boy? You says: <br />
It is a puling sample jungle of woods. You most shouts out: <br />
Bethicket me for a stump of a beech if I have the poultriest no- <br />
tions what the farest he all means. Gee up, girly! The quad gos- <br />
pellers may own the targum but any of the Zingari shoolerim <br />
may pick a peck of kindlings yet from the sack of auld hensyne.</p>

<p>Lead, kindly fowl! They always did: ask the ages. What bird <br />
has done yesterday man may do next year, be it fly, be it moult, <br />
be it hatch, be it agreement in the nest. For her socioscientific <br />
sense is sound as a bell, sir, her volucrine automutativeness right <br />
on normalcy: she knows, she just feels she was kind of born to <br />
lay and love eggs (trust her to propagate the species and hoosh <br />
her fluffballs safe through din and danger!); lastly but mostly, in <br />
her genesic field it is all game and no gammon; she is ladylike in <br />
everything she does and plays the gentleman’s part every time. <br />
Let us auspice it! Yes, before all this has time to end the golden <br />
age must return with its vengeance. Man will become dirigible, <br />
Ague will be rejuvenated, woman with her ridiculous white bur- <br />
den will reach by one step sublime incubation, the manewanting <br />
human lioness with her dishorned discipular manram will lie <br />
down together publicly flank upon fleece. No, assuredly, they are <br />
not justified, those gloompourers who grouse that letters have <br />
never been quite their old selves again since that weird weekday <br />
in bleak Janiveer (yet how palmy date in a waste’s oasis!) when <br />
to the shock of both, Biddy Doran looked at literature.</p>

<p>And. She may be a mere marcella, this midget madgetcy, <br />
Misthress of Arths. But. It is not a hear or say of some anomo- <br />
rous letter, signed Toga Girilis, (teasy dear). We have a cop of <br />
her fist right against our nosibos. We note the paper with her <br />
jotty young watermark: <em>Notre Dame du Bon Marché</em>. And she <br />
has a heart of Arin! What lumililts as she fols with her falli- <br />
mineers and her nadianods. As a strow will shaw she does the <br />
wind blague, recting to show the rudess of a robur curling and <br />
shewing the fansaties of a frizette. But how many of her readers<span></span></p>
