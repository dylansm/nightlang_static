<p class="ni">soully when ’tis thime took o’er home, gin. We cannot say aye <br />
to aye. We cannot smile noes from noes. Still. One cannot help <br />
noticing that rather more than half of the lines run north-south <br />
in the Nemzes and Bukarahast directions while the others go <br />
west-east in search from Maliziies with Bulgarad for, tiny tot <br />
though it looks when schtschupnistling alongside other incuna- <br />
bula, it has its cardinal points for all that. These ruled barriers <br />
along which the traced words, run, march, halt, walk, stumble <br />
at doubtful points, stumble up again in comparative safety seem <br />
to have been drawn first of all in a pretty checker with lamp- <br />
black and blackthorn. Such crossing is antechristian of course, <br />
but the use of the homeborn shillelagh as an aid to calligraphy <br />
shows a distinct advance from savagery to barbarism. It is <br />
seriously believed by some that the intention may have been <br />
geodetic, or, in the view of the cannier, domestic economical. <br />
But by writing thithaways end to end and turning, turning and <br />
end to end hithaways writing and with lines of litters slittering <br />
up and louds of latters slettering down, the old semetomyplace <br />
and jupetbackagain from tham Let Rise till Hum Lit. Sleep, <br />
where in the waste is the wisdom?</p>

<p>Another point, in addition to the original sand, pounce pow- <br />
der, drunkard paper or soft rag used (any vet or inhanger in <br />
ous sot’s social can see the seen for seemself, a wee ftofty od <br />
room, the cheery spluttered on the one karrig, a darka disheen <br />
of voos from Dalbania, any gotsquantity of racky, a portogal <br />
and some buk setting out on the sofer, you remember the <br />
sort of softball sucker motru used to tell us when we were all <br />
biribiyas or nippies and messas) it has acquired accretions of <br />
terricious matter whilst loitering in the past. The teatimestained <br />
terminal (say not the tag, mummer, or our show’s a failure!) is a <br />
cosy little brown study all to oneself and, whether it be thumb- <br />
print, mademark or just a poor trait of the artless, its importance <br />
in establishing the identities in the writer complexus (for if the <br />
hand was one, the minds of active and agitated were more than <br />
so) will be best appreciated by never forgetting that both before <br />
and after the battle of the Boyne it was a habit not to sign letters<span></span></p>
