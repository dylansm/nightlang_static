<p class="ni">always. Tip. And it is surely a lesser ignorance to write a word <br />
with every consonant too few than to add all too many. The <br />
end? Say it with missiles then and thus arabesque the page. You <br />
have your cup of scalding Souchong, your taper’s waxen drop, <br />
your cat’s paw, the clove or coffinnail you chewed or champed <br />
as you worded it, your lark in clear air. So why, pray, sign any- <br />
thing as long as every word, letter, penstroke, paperspace is a <br />
perfect signature of its own? A true friend is known much more <br />
easily, and better into the bargain, by his personal touch, habits <br />
of full or undress, movements, response to appeals for charity <br />
than by his footwear, say. And, speaking anent Tiberias and other <br />
incestuish salacities among gerontophils, a word of warning <br />
about the tenderloined passion hinted at. Some softnosed per- <br />
user might mayhem take it up erogenously as the usual case of <br />
spoons, <em>prostituta in herba</em> plus dinky pinks deliberatively summer- <br />
saulting off her bisexycle, at the main entrance of curate’s per- <br />
petual soutane suit with her one to see and awoh! who picks her <br />
up as gingerly as any balmbearer would to feel whereupon the <br />
virgin was most hurt and nicely asking: whyre have you been so <br />
grace a mauling and where were you chaste me child? Be who, <br />
farther potential? and so wider but we grisly old Sykos who have <br />
done our unsmiling bit on ’alices, when they were yung and <br />
easily freudened, in the penumbra of the procuring room and <br />
what oracular comepression we have had apply to them! could <br />
(did we care to sell our feebought silence <em>in camera</em>) tell our very <br />
moistnostrilled one that <em>father</em> in such virgated contexts is not <br />
always that undemonstrative relative (often held up to our con- <br />
tumacy) who settles our hashbill for us and what an innocent all- <br />
abroad’s adverb such as Michaelly looks like can be suggestive <br />
of under the pudendascope and, finally, what a neurasthene nym- <br />
pholept, endocrine-pineal typus, of inverted parentage with a <br />
prepossessing drauma present in her past and a priapic urge for <br />
congress with agnates before cognates fundamentally is feeling <br />
for under her lubricitous meiosis when she refers with liking to <br />
some feeler she fancie’s face. And Mm. We could. Yet what need <br />
to say? ’Tis as human a little story as paper could well carry, in<span></span></p>
