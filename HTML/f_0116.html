horses, for we also know, what we have perused from the pages <br />
of <em>I Was A Gemral</em>, that Showting up of Bulsklivism by ‘Schot- <br />
tenboum’, that Father Michael about this red time of the white <br />
terror equals the old regime and Margaret is the social revolution <br />
while cakes mean the party funds and dear thank you signifies <br />
national gratitude. In fine, we have heard, as it happened, of <br />
Spartacus intercellular. We are not corknered yet, dead hand! <br />
We can recall, with voluntears, the froggy jew, and sweeter far <br />

milkmike in the language of sweet tarts punch hell’s hate into his <br />
twin nicky and that Maggy’s tea, or your majesty, if heard as a <br />
boost from a born gentleman is (?). For if the lingo gasped between <br />
kicksheets, however basically English, were to be preached from <br />
the mouths of wickerchurchwardens and metaphysicians in the <br />
row and advokaatoes, allvoyous, demivoyelles, languoaths, les- <br />
biels, dentelles, gutterhowls and furtz, where would their prac- <br />

grunted and gromwelled, ichabod, habakuk, opanoff, uggamyg, <br />

some sacking left on a coarse cart?</p>
