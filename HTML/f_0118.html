to volt back to our desultory horses, and for your roughshod <br />
mind, bafflelost bull, the affair is a thing once for all done and <br />
there you are somewhere and finished in a certain time, be it a <br />
day or a year or even supposing, it should eventually turn out <br />
to be a serial number of goodness gracious alone knows how <br />
many days or years. Anyhow, somehow and somewhere, before <br />
the bookflood or after her ebb, somebody mentioned by name in <br />
his telephone directory, Coccolanius or Gallotaurus, wrote it, <br />
wrote it all, wrote it all down, and there you are, full stop. O, <br />
undoubtedly yes, and very potably so, but one who deeper thinks <br />

acinthinous riot of blots and blurs and bars and balls and hoops <br />
and wriggles and juxtaposed jottings linked by spurts of speed: <br />
it only looks as like it as damn it; and, sure, we ought really to <br />
rest thankful that at this deleteful hour of dungflies dawning we <br />
have even a written on with dried ink scrap of paper at all to show <br />
