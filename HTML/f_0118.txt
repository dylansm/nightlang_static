to volt back to our desultory horses, and for your roughshod  
mind, bafflelost bull, the affair is a thing once for all done and  
there you are somewhere and finished in a certain time, be it a  
day or a year or even supposing, it should eventually turn out  
to be a serial number of goodness gracious alone knows how  
many days or years. Anyhow, somehow and somewhere, before  
the bookflood or after her ebb, somebody mentioned by name in  
his telephone directory, Coccolanius or Gallotaurus, wrote it,
