<p class="ni">taken for pews with their tails in their mouths, thence your <br />
pristopher polombos, hence our Kat Kresbyterians; the curt <br />
witty wotty dashes never quite just right at the trim trite <br />
truth letter; the sudden spluttered petulance of some capItalIsed <br />
Middle; a word as cunningly hidden in its maze of confused <br />
drapery as a fieldmouse in a nest of coloured ribbons: that ab- <br />
surdly bullsfooted bee declaring with an even plainer dummp- <br />
show than does the mute commoner with us how hard a thing it <br />
is to mpe mporn a gentlerman: and look at this prepronominal <br />

padded, very like a whale’s egg farced with pemmican, as were it <br />
sentenced to be nuzzled over a full trillion times for ever and a <br />
night till his noddle sink or swim by that ideal reader suffering <br />
from an ideal insomnia: all those red raddled obeli cayennepep- <br />

omissions, repetitions and misalignments: that (probably local or <br />
personal) variant <em>maggers</em> for the more generally accepted <em>ma- <br />
jesty</em> which is but a trifle and yet may quietly amuse: those super- <br />
ciliouslooking crisscrossed Greek ees awkwardlike perched there <br />

the geegees too, jesuistically formed at first but afterwards genu- <br />
flected aggrily toewards the occident: the Ostrogothic kako- <br />
graphy affected for certain phrases of Etruscan stabletalk and, in <br />
short, the learning betrayed at almost every line’s end: the head- <br />
strength (at least eleven men of thirtytwo palfrycraft) revealed <br />
by a constant labour to make a ghimel pass through the eye of an <br />
iota: this, for instance, utterly unexpected sinistrogyric return to <br />
one peculiar sore point in the past; those throne open doubleyous <br />
(of an early muddy terranean origin whether man chooses to <br />
damn them agglutinatively loo<span class="em">—</span>too<span class="em">—</span>blue<span class="em">—</span>face<span class="em">—</span>ache or <br />

floprightdown determination and reminding uus ineluctably of <br />
nature at her naturalest while that fretful fidget eff, the hornful <br />
digamma of your bornabarbar, rarely heard now save when falling <br />
from the unfashionable lipsus of some hetarosexual (used always <br />
