pristopher polombos, hence our Kat Kresbyterians; the curt  
witty wotty dashes never quite just right at the trim trite  
truth letter; the sudden spluttered petulance of some capItalIsed  
Middle; a word as cunningly hidden in its maze of confused  
drapery as a fieldmouse in a nest of coloured ribbons: that ab-  
surdly bullsfooted bee declaring with an even plainer dummp-  
show than does the mute commoner with us how hard a thing it  
is to mpe mporn a gentlerman: and look at this prepronominal  
*funferal*, engraved and retouched and edgewiped and pudden-  
padded, very like a whale’s egg farced with pemmican, as were it  
sentenced to be nuzzled over a full trillion times for ever and a  
night till his noddle sink or swim by that ideal reader suffering

strength (at least eleven men of thirtytwo palfrycraft) revealed  
by a constant labour to make a ghimel pass through the eye of an  
iota: this, for instance, utterly unexpected sinistrogyric return to  
one peculiar sore point in the past; those throne open doubleyous  
(of an early muddy terranean origin whether man chooses to  
damn them agglutinatively loo%—%too%—%blue%—%face%—%ache or  
illvoodawpeehole or, kants koorts, topplefouls) seated with such
