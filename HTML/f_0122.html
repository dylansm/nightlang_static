<p class="ni">ampersands under which we can glypse at and feel for ourselves <br />
across all those rushyears the warm soft short pants of the quick- <br />
scribbler: the vocative lapse from which it begins and the accu- <br />
sative hole in which it ends itself; the aphasia of that heroic agony <br />
of recalling a once loved number leading slip by slipper to a <br />
general amnesia of misnomering one’s own: next those ars, rrrr! <br />
those ars all bellical, the highpriest’s hieroglyph of kettletom and <br />
oddsbones, wrasted redhandedly from our hallowed rubric prayer <br />
for truce with booty, <em>O’Remus pro Romulo</em>, and rudely from the <br />
fane’s pinnacle tossed down by porter to within an aim’s ace of <br />
their quatrain of rubyjets among Those Who arse without the <br />
Temple nor since Roe’s Distillery burn’d have quaff’d Night’s <br />

then (coming over to the left aisle corner down) the cruciform <br />
postscript from which three <em>basia</em> or shorter and smaller oscula <br />
have been overcarefully scraped away, plainly inspiring the tene- <br />
brous <em>Tunc</em> page of the Book of Kells (and then it need not be <br />
lost sight of that there are exactly three squads of candidates for <br />
the crucian rose awaiting their turn in the marginal panels of <br />
Columkiller, chugged in their three ballotboxes, then set apart for <br />
such hanging committees, where two was enough for anyone, <br />
starting with old Matthew himself, as he with great distinction <br />
said then just as since then people speaking have fallen into the <br />
custom, when speaking to a person, of saying two is company <br />
when the third person is the person darkly spoken of, and then <br />
that last labiolingual <em>basium</em> might be read as a <em>suavium</em> if who- <br />
ever the embracer then was wrote with a tongue in his (or per- <br />
haps her) cheek as the case may have been then) and the fatal <br />
droopadwindle slope of the blamed scrawl, a sure sign of imper- <br />
fectible moral blindness; the toomuchness, the fartoomanyness</p>
