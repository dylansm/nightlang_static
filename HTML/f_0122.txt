%ni%ampersands under which we can glypse at and feel for ourselves  
across all those rushyears the warm soft short pants of the quick-  
scribbler: the vocative lapse from which it begins and the accu-  
sative hole in which it ends itself; the aphasia of that heroic agony  
of recalling a once loved number leading slip by slipper to a  
general amnesia of misnomering one’s own: next those ars, rrrr!  
those ars all bellical, the highpriest’s hieroglyph of kettletom and  
oddsbones, wrasted redhandedly from our hallowed rubric prayer  
for truce with booty, *O’Remus pro Romulo*, and rudely from the  
fane’s pinnacle tossed down by porter to within an aim’s ace of  
their quatrain of rubyjets among Those Who arse without the  
Temple nor since Roe’s Distillery burn’d have quaff’d Night’s

brous *Tunc* page of the Book of Kells (and then it need not be  
lost sight of that there are exactly three squads of candidates for  
the crucian rose awaiting their turn in the marginal panels of  
Columkiller, chugged in their three ballotboxes, then set apart for  
such hanging committees, where two was enough for anyone,  
starting with old Matthew himself, as he with great distinction  
said then just as since then people speaking have fallen into the  
custom, when speaking to a person, of saying two is company  
when the third person is the person darkly spoken of, and then  
that last labiolingual *basium* might be read as a *suavium* if who-  
ever the embracer then was wrote with a tongue in his (or per-
