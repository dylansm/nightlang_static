<p class="ni">a horologe unstoppable and the Benn of all bells; fuit, isst and <br />
herit and though he’s mildewstaned he’s mouldystoned; is a quer- <br />
cuss in the forest but plane member for Megalopolis; mountun- <br />
mighty, faunonfleetfoot; plank in our platform, blank in our <br />
scouturn; hidal, in carucates he is enumerated, hold as an earl, <br />
he counts; shipshaped phrase of buglooking words with a form <br />
like the easing moments of a graminivorous; to our dooms <br />
brought he law, our manoirs he made his vill of; was an over- <br />
grind to the underground and acqueduced for fierythroats; sends <br />
boys in socks acoughawhooping when he lets farth his carbon- <br />
oxside and silk stockings show her shapings when he looses hose <br />
on hers; stocks dry puder for the Ill people and pinkun’s pellets <br />
for all the Pale; gave his mundyfoot to Miserius, her pinch to <br />
Anna Livia, that superfine pigtail to Cerisia Cerosia and quid <br />
rides to Titius, Caius and Sempronius; made the man who had <br />
no notion of shopkeepers feel he’d rather play the duke than play <br />
the gentleman; shot two queans and shook three caskles when <br />
he won his game of dwarfs; fumes inwards like a strombolist till <br />
he smokes at both ends; manmote, befier of him, womankind, <br />
pietad!; shows one white drift of snow among the gorsegrowth <br />
of his crown and a chaperon of repentance on that which shed <br />
gore; pause and quies, triple bill; went by metro for the polis and <br />
then hoved by; to the finders, hail! woa, you that seek!; whom <br />
fillth had plenished, dearth devoured; hock is leading, cocoa comes <br />
next, emery tries for the flag; can dance the O’Bruin’s polerpasse <br />
at Noolahn to his own orchistruss accompaniment; took place <br />
before the internatural convention of catholic midwives and <br />
found stead before the congress for the study of endonational <br />
calamities; makes a delictuous <em>entrée</em> and finishes off the course <br />
between sweets and savouries; flouts for forecasts, flairs for finds <br />
and the fun of the fray on the fairground; cleared out three hun- <br />
dred sixty five idles to set up one all khalassal for henwives hoping <br />
to have males; the flawhoolagh, the grasping one, the kindler of <br />
paschal fire; forbids us our trespassers as we forgate him; the <br />
phoenix be his pyre, the cineres his sire!; piles big pelium on <br />
little ossas like the pilluls of hirculeads; has an eatupus complex<span></span></p>
