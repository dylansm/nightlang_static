<p class="ni">life; Mount of Mish, Mell of Moy; had two cardinal ventures and <br />
three capitol sinks; has a peep in his pocketbook and a packet- <br />
boat in his keep; B.V.H., B.L.G., P.P.M., T.D.S., V.B.D., <br />
T.C.H., L.O.N.; is Breakfates, Lunger, Diener and Souper; as <br />
the streets were paved with cold he felt his topperairy; taught <br />
himself skating and learned how to fall; distinctly dirty but rather <br />
a dear; hoveth chieftains evrywehr, with morder; Ostman <br />
Effendi, Serge Paddishaw; baases two mmany, outpriams al’ <br />
his parisites; first of the fenians, <em>roi des fainéants</em>; his Tiara of <br />
scones was held unfillable. till one Liam Fail felled him in West- <br />
munster; was struck out of his sittem when he rowed saulely to <br />
demask us and to our appauling predicament brought as plagues <br />
from Buddapest; put a matchhead on an aspenstalk and set the <br />
living a fire; speared the rod and spoiled the lightning; married <br />
with cakes and repunked with pleasure; till he was buried how- <br />
happy was he and he made the welkins ring with <em>Up Micawber!</em>; <br />
god at the top of the staircase, carrion on the mat of straw; <br />
the false hood of a spindler web chokes the cavemouth of his <br />
unsightliness but the nestlings that liven his leafscreen sing him <br />
a lover of arbuties; we strike hands over his bloodied warsheet <br />
but we are pledged entirely to his green mantle; our friend <br />
vikelegal, our swaran foi; under the four stones by his streams <br />
who vanished the wassailbowl at the joy of shells; Mora and <br />
Lora had a hill of a high time looking down on his confusion till <br />
firm look in readiness, forward spear and the windfoot of curach <br />
strewed the lakemist of Lego over the last of his fields; we <br />
darkened for you, faulterer, in the year of mourning but we’ll <br />
fidhil to the dimtwinklers when the streamy morvenlight calls up <br />
the sunbeam; his striped pantaloons, his rather strange walk; <br />
<em>hereditatis columna erecta, hagion chiton eraphon</em>; nods a nap for <br />
the nonce but crows cheerio when they get ecunemical; is a simul- <br />
taneous equator of elimbinated integras when three upon one is <br />
by inspection improper; has the most conical hodpiece of con- <br />
fusianist heronim and that chuchuffuous chinchin of his is like <br />
a footsey kungoloo around Taishantyland; he’s as globeful as a <br />
gasometer of lithium and luridity and he was thrice ten anular<span></span></p>
