<p class="ni">years before he wallowed round Raggiant Circos; the cabalstone <br />
at the coping of his cavin is a canine constant but only an amiri- <br />
can could apparoxemete the apeupresiosity of his atlast’s alonge- <br />
ment; sticklered rights and lefts at Baddersdown in his hunt for <br />
the boar trwth but made his end with the modareds that came <br />
at him in Camlenstrete; a hunnibal in exhaustive conflict, an otho <br />
to return; burning body to aiger air on melting mountain in <br />
wooing wave; we go into him sleepy children, we come out of <br />
him strucklers for life; he divested to save from the Mrs Drown- <br />
ings their rival queens while Grimshaw, Bragshaw and Renshaw <br />
made off with his storen clothes; taxed and rated, licensed and <br />
ranted; his threefaced stonehead was found on a whitehorse hill <br />
and the print of his costellous feet is seen in the goat’s grass- <br />
circle; pull the blind, toll the deaf and call dumb, lame and halty; <br />
Miraculone, Monstrucceleen; led the upplaws at the Creation and <br />
hissed a snake charmer off her stays; hounded become haunter, <br />
hunter become fox; harrier, marrier, terrier, tav; Olaph the Ox- <br />
man, Thorker the Tourable; you feel he is Vespasian yet you <br />
think of him as Aurelius; whugamore, tradertory, socianist, com- <br />
moniser; made a summer assault on our shores and begiddy got <br />
his sands full; first he shot down Raglan Road and then he tore <br />
up Marlborough Place; Cromlechheight and Crommalhill were <br />
his farfamed feetrests when our lurch as lout let free into the <br />
Lubar heloved; mareschalled his wardmotes and delimited the <br />
main; netted before nibbling, can scarce turn a scale but, grossed <br />
after meals, weighs a town in himself; Banba prayed for his con- <br />
version, Beurla missed that grand old voice; a Colossus among <br />
cabbages, the Melarancitrone of fruits; larger than life, doughtier <br />
than death; Gran Turco, orege forment; lachsembulger, leperlean; <br />
the sparkle of his genial fancy, the depth of his calm sagacity, the <br />
clearness of his spotless honour, the flow of his boundless bene- <br />
volence; our family furbear, our tribal tarnpike; quary was he <br />
invincibled and cur was he burked; partitioned Irskaholm, united <br />
Irishmen; he took a svig at his own methyr but she tested a bit <br />
gorky and as for the salmon he was coming up in him all life <br />
long; comm, eilerdich hecklebury and sawyer thee warden;</p>
