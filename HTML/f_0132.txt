%ni%years before he wallowed round Raggiant Circos; the cabalstone  
at the coping of his cavin is a canine constant but only an amiri-  
can could apparoxemete the apeupresiosity of his atlast’s alonge-  
ment; sticklered rights and lefts at Baddersdown in his hunt for  
the boar trwth but made his end with the modareds that came  
at him in Camlenstrete; a hunnibal in exhaustive conflict, an otho  
to return; burning body to aiger air on melting mountain in  
wooing wave; we go into him sleepy children, we come out of  
him strucklers for life; he divested to save from the Mrs Drown-  
ings their rival queens while Grimshaw, Bragshaw and Renshaw  
made off with his storen clothes; taxed and rated, licensed and

after meals, weighs a town in himself; Banba prayed for his con-  
version, Beurla missed that grand old voice; a Colossus among  
cabbages, the Melarancitrone of fruits; larger than life, doughtier  
than death; Gran Turco, orege forment; lachsembulger, leperlean;  
the sparkle of his genial fancy, the depth of his calm sagacity, the  
clearness of his spotless honour, the flow of his boundless bene-  
volence; our family furbear, our tribal tarnpike; quary was he
