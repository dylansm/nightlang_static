<p class="ni">silent as the bee in honey, stark as the breath on hauwck, Cos- <br />
tello, Kinsella, Mahony, Moran, though you rope Amrique your <br />
home ruler is Dan; figure right, he is hoisted by the scurve of <br />
his shaggy neck, figure left, he is rationed in isobaric patties <br />
among the crew; one asks was he poisoned, one thinks how much <br />
did he leave; ex-gardener (Riesengebirger), fitted up with <br />
planturous existencies would make Roseoogreedy (mite’s) little <br />
hose; taut sheets and scuppers awash but the oil silk mack Lieb- <br />
sterpet micks his aquascutum; the enjoyment he took in kay <br />
women, the employment he gave to gee men; sponsor to a squad <br />
of piercers, ally to a host of rawlies; against lightning, explosion, <br />
fire, earthquake, flood, whirlwind, burglary, third party, rot, loss <br />
of cash, loss of credit, impact of vehicles; can rant as grave as <br />
oxtail soup and chat as gay as a porto flippant; is unhesitent in <br />
his unionism and yet a pigotted nationalist; Sylviacola is shy of <br />
him, Matrosenhosens nose the joke; shows the sinews of peace in <br />
his chest-o-wars; fiefeofhome, ninehundred and thirtunine years <br />
of copyhold; is aldays open for polemypolity’s sake when he’s not <br />
suntimes closed for the love of Janus; sucks life’s eleaxir from <br />
the pettipickles of the Jewess and ruoulls in sulks if any popeling <br />
runs down the Huguenots; Boomaport, Walleslee, Ubermeerschall <br />
Blowcher and Supercharger, Monsieur Ducrow, Mister Mudson, <br />
master gardiner; to one he’s just paunch and judex, to another <br />
full of beans and brehons; hallucination, cauchman, ectoplasm; <br />
passed for baabaa blacksheep till he grew white woo woo woolly; <br />
was drummatoysed by Mac Milligan’s daughter and put to music <br />
by one shoebard; all fitzpatricks in his emirate remember him, the <br />
boys of wetford hail him babu; indanified himself with boro tribute <br />
and was schenkt publicly to brigstoll; was given the light in drey <br />
orchafts and entumuled in threeplexes; his likeness is in Terrecuite <br />
and he giveth rest to the rainbowed; lebriety, frothearnity and <br />
quality; his reverse makes a virtue of necessity while his obverse <br />
mars a mother by invention; beskilk his gunwale and he’s the <br />
second imperial, untie points, unhook tenters and he’s lath and <br />
plaster; calls upon Allthing when he fails to appeal to Eachovos; <br />
basidens, ardree, kongsemma, rexregulorum; stood into Dee mouth,<span></span></p>
