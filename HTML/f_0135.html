<p class="ni">his cornerwall melking mark so murry, the queen was steep in <br />
armbour feeling fain and furry, the mayds was midst the haw- <br />
thorns shoeing up their hose, out pimps the back guards (pomp!) <br />
and pump gun they goes; to all his foretellers he reared a stone <br />
and for all his comethers he planted a tree; forty acres, sixty miles, <br />
white stripe, red stripe, washes his fleet in annacrwatter; whou <br />
missed a porter so whot shall he do for he wanted to sit for <br />
Pimploco but they’ve caught him to stand for Sue?; Dutchlord, <br />
Dutchlord, overawes us; Headmound, king and martyr, dunstung <br />
in the Yeast, Pitre-le-Pore-in Petrin, Barth-the-Grete-by-the- <br />
Exchange; he hestens towards dames troth and wedding hand <br />
like the prince of Orange and Nassau while he has trinity left <br />
behind him like Bowlbeggar Bill-the-Bustonly; brow of a hazel- <br />
wood, pool in the dark; changes blowicks into bullocks and a <br />
well of Artesia into a bird of Arabia; the handwriting on his <br />
facewall, the cryptoconchoidsiphonostomata in his exprussians; <br />
his birthspot lies beyond the herospont and his burialplot in the <br />
pleasant little field; is the yldist kiosk on the pleninsula and the <br />
unguest hostel in Saint Scholarland; walked many hundreds and <br />
many score miles of streets and lit thousands in one nightlights <br />
in hectares of windows; his great wide cloak lies on fifteen acres <br />
and his little white horse decks by dozens our doors; O sorrow <br />
the sail and woe the rudder that were set for Mairie Quai!; his <br />
suns the huns, his dartars the tartars, are plenty here today; who <br />
repulsed from his burst the bombolts of Ostenton and falchioned <br />
each flash downsaduck in the deep; apersonal problem, a loca- <br />
tive enigma; upright one, vehicule of arcanisation in the field, <br />
lying chap, floodsupplier of celiculation through ebblanes; a part <br />
of the whole as a port for a whale; Dear Hewitt Castello, Equerry, <br />
were daylighted with our outing and are looking backwards to <br />
unearly summers, from Rhoda Dundrums; is above the seedfruit <br />
level and outside the leguminiferous zone; when older links lock <br />
older hearts then he’ll resemble she; can be built with glue and <br />
clippings, scrawled or voided on a buttress; the night express <br />
sings his story, the song of sparrownotes on his stave of wires; <br />
he crawls with lice, he swarms with saggarts; is as quiet as a<span></span></p>
