%ni%his cornerwall melking mark so murry, the queen was steep in  
armbour feeling fain and furry, the mayds was midst the haw-  
thorns shoeing up their hose, out pimps the back guards (pomp!)  
and pump gun they goes; to all his foretellers he reared a stone  
and for all his comethers he planted a tree; forty acres, sixty miles,  
white stripe, red stripe, washes his fleet in annacrwatter; whou  
missed a porter so whot shall he do for he wanted to sit for  
Pimploco but they’ve caught him to stand for Sue?; Dutchlord,  
Dutchlord, overawes us; Headmound, king and martyr, dunstung  
in the Yeast, Pitre-le-Pore-in Petrin, Barth-the-Grete-by-the-  
Exchange; he hestens towards dames troth and wedding hand  
like the prince of Orange and Nassau while he has trinity left  
behind him like Bowlbeggar Bill-the-Bustonly; brow of a hazel-

suns the huns, his dartars the tartars, are plenty here today; who  
repulsed from his burst the bombolts of Ostenton and falchioned  
each flash downsaduck in the deep; apersonal problem, a loca-

lying chap, floodsupplier of celiculation through ebblanes; a part  
of the whole as a port for a whale; Dear Hewitt Castello, Equerry,  
were daylighted with our outing and are looking backwards to  
unearly summers, from Rhoda Dundrums; is above the seedfruit  
level and outside the leguminiferous zone; when older links lock  
older hearts then he’ll resemble she; can be built with glue and  
clippings, scrawled or voided on a buttress; the night express  
sings his story, the song of sparrownotes on his stave of wires;  
he crawls with lice, he swarms with saggarts; is as quiet as a%j%
