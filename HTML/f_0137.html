<p class="ni">round a lamp of succar in boinyn water; three shots a puddy at <br />
up blup saddle; made up to Miss MacCormack Ni Lacarthy who <br />
made off with Darly Dermod, swank and swarthy; once diamond <br />
cut garnet now dammat cuts groany; you might find him at the <br />
Florence but watch our for him in Wynn’s Hotel; theer’s his <br />
bow and wheer’s his leaker and heer lays his bequiet hearse, <br />
deep; Swed Albiony, likeliest villain of the place; Hennery Can- <br />
terel<span class="em">—</span>Cockran, eggotisters, limitated; we take our tays and <br />
frees our fleas round sadurn’s mounted foot; built the Lund’s <br />
kirk and destroyed the church’s land; who guesse his title grabs <br />
his deeds; fletch and prities, fash and chaps; artful Juke of Wilysly; <br />
Hugglebelly’s Funniral; Kukkuk Kallikak; heard in camera and <br />
excruciated; boon when with benches billeted, bann if buckshot- <br />
backshattered; heavengendered, chaosfoedted, earthborn; his <br />
father presumptively ploughed it deep on overtime and his <br />
mother as all evince must have travailled her fair share; a foot- <br />
prinse on the Megacene, hetman unwhorsed by Searingsand; <br />
honorary captain of the extemporised fire brigade, reported to <br />
be friendly with the police; the door is still open; the old stock <br />
collar is coming back; not forgetting the time you laughed at <br />
Elder Charterhouse’s duckwhite pants and the way you said the <br />
whole township can see his hairy legs; by stealth of a kersse her <br />
aulburntress abaft his nape she hung; when his kettle became a <br />
hearthsculdus our thorstyites set their lymphyamphyre; his year- <br />
letter concocted by masterhands of assays, his hallmark imposed <br />
by the standard of wrought plate; a pair of pectorals and a triple- <br />
screen to get a wind up; lights his pipe with a rosin tree and hires <br />
a towhorse to haul his shoes; cures slavey’s scurvy, breaks <br />
barons boils; called to sell polosh and was found later in a bed- <br />
room; has his seat of justice, his house of mercy, his com o’copious <br />
and his stacks a’rye; prospector, he had a rooksacht, retrospector, <br />
he holds the holpenstake; won the freedom of new yoke for the <br />
minds of jugoslaves; acts active, peddles in passivism and is a <br />
gorgon of selfridgeousness; pours a laughsworth of his illforma- <br />
tion over a larmsworth of salt; half heard the single maiden <br />
speech La Belle spun to her Grand Mount and wholed a lifetime<span></span></p>
