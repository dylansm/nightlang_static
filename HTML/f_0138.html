<p class="ni">by his ain fireside, wondering was it hebrew set to himmeltones <br />
or the quicksilversong of qwaternions; his troubles may be over <br />
but his doubles have still to come; the lobster pot that crabbed <br />
our keel, the garden pet that spoiled our squeezed peas; he stands <br />
in a lovely park, sea is not far, importunate towns of X, Y and <br />
Z are easily over reached; is an excrescence to civilised humanity <br />
and but a wart on Europe; wanamade singsigns to soundsense <br />
an yit he wanna git all his flesch nuemaid motts truly prural and <br />
plusible; has excisively large rings and is uncustomarily perfumed; <br />
lusteth ath he listeth the cleah whithpeh of a themise; is a prince <br />
of the fingallian in a hiberniad of hoolies; has a hodge to wherry <br />
him and a frenchy to curry him and a brabanson for his beeter and <br />
a fritz at his switch; was waylaid of a parker and beschotten by a <br />
buckeley; kicks lintils when he’s cuppy and casts Jacob’s arroroots, <br />
dime after dime, to poor waifstrays on the perish; reads the charms <br />
of H. C. Endersen all the weaks of his evenin and the crimes of <br />
Ivaun the Taurrible every strongday morn; soaps you soft to your <br />
face and slaps himself when he’s badend; owns the bulgiest bung- <br />
barrel that ever was tiptapped in the privace of the Mullingar <br />
Inn; was bom with a nuasilver tongue in his mouth and went <br />
round the coast of Iron with his lift hand to the scene; raised but <br />
two fingers and yet smelt it would day; for whom it is easier to <br />
found a see in Ebblannah than for I or you to find a dubbeltye <br />
in Dampsterdamp; to live with whom is a lifemayor and to know <br />
whom a liberal education; was dipped in Hoily Olives and chrys- <br />
med in Scent Otooles; hears cricket on the earth but annoys the <br />
life out of predikants; still turns the durc’s ear of Darius to the <br />
now thoroughly infurioted’ one of God; made Man with juts <br />
that jerk and minted money mong maney; likes a six acup pud- <br />
ding when he’s come whome sweetwhome; has come through all <br />
the eras of livsadventure from moonshine and shampaying down <br />
to clouts and pottled porter; woollem the farsed, hahnreich the <br />
althe, charge the sackend, writchad the thord; if a mandrake <br />
shricked to convultures at last surviving his birth the weibduck <br />
will wail bitternly over the rotter’s resurrection; loses weight in <br />
the moon night but gird girder by the sundawn; with one touch<span></span></p>
