<p class="ni">of nature set a veiled world agrin and went within a sheet of <br />
tissuepaper of the option of three gaols; who could see at one <br />
blick a saumon taken with a lance, hunters pursuing a doe, a <br />
swallowship in full sail, a whyterobe lifting a host; faced flappery <br />
like old King Cnut and turned his back like Cincinnatus; is a <br />
farfar and morefar and a hoar father Nakedbucker in villas old as <br />
new; squats aquart and cracks aquaint when it’s flaggin in town <br />
and on haven; blows whiskery around his summit but stehts <br />
stout upon his footles; stutters fore he falls and goes mad entirely <br />
when he’s waked; is Timb to the pearly mom and Tomb to the <br />
mourning night; and an he had the best bunbaked bricks in bould <br />
Babylon for his pitching plays he’d be lost for the want of his <br />
wan wubblin wall?</p>

<li>Does your mutter know your mike?</li>
</ol>

<p>Answer: When I tum meoptics, from suchurban prospects, <br />
’tis my filial’s bosom, doth behold with pride, that pontificator, <br />
and circumvallator, with his dam night garrulous, slipt by his <br />
side. Ann alive, the lisp of her, ’twould grig mountains whisper <br />
her, and the bergs of Iceland melt in waves of fire, and her spoon- <br />
me-spondees, and her dirckle-me-ondenees, make the Rageous <br />
Ossean, kneel and quaff a lyre! If Dann’s dane, Ann’s dirty, if <br />
he’s plane she’s purty, if he’s fane, she’s flirty, with her auburnt <br />
streams, and her coy cajoleries, and her dabblin drolleries, for to <br />
rouse his rudderup, or to drench his dreams. If hot Hammurabi, <br />
or cowld Clesiastes, could espy her pranklings, they’d burst <br />
bounds agin, and renounce their ruings, and denounce their do- <br />
ings, for river and iver, and a night. Amin!</p>
