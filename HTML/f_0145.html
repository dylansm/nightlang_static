leprous off her whatever winking maggis I’ll bet by your cut <br />
you go fleurting after with all the glass on her and the jumps <br />
in her stomewhere! Haha! I suspected she was! Sink her! May <br />
they fire her for a barren ewe! So she says: Tay for thee? Well, I <br />
saith: Angst so mush: and desired she might not take it amiss if I <br />
esteemed her but an odd. If I did ate toughturf I’m not a mishy- <br />
missy. Of course I know, pettest, you’re so learningful and <br />
considerate in yourself, so friend of vegetables, you long cold cat <br />
you! Please by acquiester to meek my acquointance! Codling, <br />
snakelet, iciclist! My diaper has more life to it! Who drowned <br />
you in drears, man, or are you pillale with ink? Did a weep get <br />

Yes, the buttercups told me, hug me, damn it all, and I’ll kiss <br />

Ah, did you speak, stuffstuff? More poestries from Chickspeer’s <br />
with gleechoreal music or a jaculation from the garden of the <br />
soul. Of I be leib in the immoralities? O, you mean the strangle <br />
for love and the sowiveall of the prettiest? Yep, we open hap <br />
coseries in the home. And once upon a week I improve on myself <br />
I’m so keen on that New Free Woman with novel inside. I’m <br />
always as tickled as can be over Man in a Surplus by the Lady <br />
who Pays the Rates. But I’m as pie as is possible. Let’s root <br />
out Brimstoker and give him the thrall of our lives. It’s Dracula’s <br />
nightout. For creepsake don’t make a flush! Draw the shades, <br />
