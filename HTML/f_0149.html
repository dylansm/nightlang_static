or wringing his handcuffs for peace, the blind blighter, praying <br />
Dieuf and Domb Nostrums foh thomethinks to eath; if he <br />
weapt while he leapt and guffalled quith a quhimper, made cold <br />
blood a blue mundy and no bones without flech, taking kiss, <br />

ing wind that to wiles, woemaid sin he was partial, we don’t <br />

<p>Answer: No, blank ye! So you think I have impulsivism? Did <br />
they tell you I am one of the fortysixths? And I suppose you <br />
heard I had a wag on my ears? And I suppose they told you too <br />
that my roll of life is not natural? But before proceeding to con- <br />
clusively confute this begging question it would be far fitter for <br />
you, if you dare! to hasitate to consult with and consequentially <br />
attempt at my disposale of the same dime-cash problem elsewhere <br />
naturalistically of course, from the blinkpoint of so eminent a <br />
spatialist. From it you will here notice, Schott, upon my for the <br />
first remarking you that the sophology of Bitchson while driven <br />
as under by a purely dime-dime urge is not without his cashcash <br />
characktericksticks, borrowed for its nonce ends from the fiery <br />
goodmother Miss Fortune (who the lost time we had the pleasure <br />
we have had our little <em>recherché</em> brush with, what, Schott?) and <br />
as I further could have told you as brisk as your D.B.C. beha- <br />
viouristically <em>pailleté</em> with a coat of homoid icing which is in <br />
reality only a done by chance ridiculisation of the whoo-whoo <br />
and where’s hairs theorics of Winestain. To put it all the more <br />
plumbsily. The speechform is a mere sorrogate. Whilst the qua- <br />
lity and tality (I shall explex what you ought to mean by this with <br />
its proper when and where and why and how in the subsequent <br />
sentence) are alternativomentally harrogate and arrogate, as the <br />
gates may be.</p>

<p>Talis is a word often abused by many passims (I am working <br />
out a quantum theory about it for it is really most tantumising <br />
state of affairs). A pessim may frequent you to say: Have you been<span></span></p>
