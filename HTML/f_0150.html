<p class="ni">seeing much of Talis and Talis those times? optimately meaning: <br />
Will you put up at hree of irish? Or a ladyeater may perhaps have <br />
casualised as you temptoed her <em>à la sourdine:</em> Of your plates? Is <br />
Talis de Talis, the swordswallower, who is on at the Craterium <br />
the same Talis von Talis, the penscrusher, no funk you! who runs <br />
his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps cleaner example. At a recent <br />
postvortex piece infustigation of a determinised case of chronic <br />
spinosis an extension lecturer on The Ague who out of matter of <br />
form was trying his seesers, Dr’s Het Ubeleeft, borrowed the <br />
question: Why’s which Suchman’s <em>talis qualis?</em> to whom, as a <br />
fatter of macht, Dr Gedankje of Stoutgirth, who was wiping his <br />
whistle, toarsely retoarted: While thou beast’ one zoom of a <br />
whorl! (Talis and Talis originally mean the same thing, hit it’s: <br />
Qualis.)</p>

<p>Professor Loewy-Brueller (though as I shall promptly prove <br />
his whole account of the Sennacherib as distinct from the Shal- <br />
manesir sanitational reforms and of the Mr Skekels and Dr <br />
Hydes problem in the same connection differs <em>toto coelo</em> from the <br />
fruit of my own investigations<span class="em">—</span>though the reason I went to <br />
Jericho must remain for certain reasons a political secret<span class="em">—</span> 
especially as I shall shortly be wanted in Cavantry, I congratulate <br />
myself, for the same and other reasons<span class="em">—</span>as being again hope- <br />
lessly vitiated by what I have now resolved to call the dime and <br />
cash diamond fallacy) in his talked off confession which recently <br />
met with such a leonine uproar on its escape after its confinement <br />
<em>Why am I not born like a Gentileman and why am I now so speak- <br />
able about my own eatables</em> (Feigenbaumblatt and Father, Juda- <br />
pest, 5688, A.M.) whole-heartedly takes off his gabbercoat and <br />
wig, honest draughty fellow, in his public interest, to make us <br />
see how though, as he says: ‘by Allswill’ the inception and the <br />
descent and the endswell of Man is <em>temporarily</em> wrapped in ob- <br />
scenity, looking through at these accidents with the faroscope of <br />
television, (this nightlife instrument needs still some subtrac- <br />
tional betterment in the readjustment of the more refrangible <br />
angles to the squeals of his hypothesis on the outer tin sides), I <br />
can easily believe heartily in my own most spacious immensity<span></span></p>
