Talis de Talis, the swordswallower, who is on at the Craterium  
the same Talis von Talis, the penscrusher, no funk you! who runs  
his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps cleaner example. At a recent  
postvortex piece infustigation of a determinised case of chronic  
spinosis an extension lecturer on The Ague who out of matter of  
form was trying his seesers, Dr’s Het Ubeleeft, borrowed the

cash diamond fallacy) in his talked off confession which recently  
met with such a leonine uproar on its escape after its confinement

wig, honest draughty fellow, in his public interest, to make us  
see how though, as he says: ‘by Allswill’ the inception and the  
descent and the endswell of Man is *temporarily* wrapped in ob-
