where I cling true’tis there I climb tree and where Innocent looks <br />

<p>As my explanations here are probably above your understand- <br />

as Cadwan, Cadwallon and Cadwalloner, I shall revert to a more <br />
expletive method which I frequently use when I have to sermo <br />
with muddlecrass pupils. Imagine for my purpose that you are a <br />
squad of urchins, snifflynosed, goslingnecked, clothyheaded, <br />
tangled in your lacings, tingled in your pants, etsitaraw etcicero. <br />
And you, Bruno Nowlan, take your tongue out of your inkpot! <br />

and had borgeously letout gardens strown with cascadas, pinta- <br />
costecas, horthoducts and currycombs) and set off from Luds- <br />
town a <em>spasso</em> to see how badness was badness in the weirdest of <br />
all pensible ways.</p>

<p>As he set off with his father’s sword, his <em>lancia spezzata</em>, he was <br />
