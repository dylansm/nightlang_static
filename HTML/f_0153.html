one oneth of the propecies, <em>Amnis Limina Permanent</em>) upon the <br />
most unconsciously boggylooking stream he ever locked his <br />
eyes with. Out of the colliens it took a rise by daubing itself Ni- <br />
non. It looked little and it smelt of brown and it thought in nar- <br />
rows and it talked showshallow. And as it rinn it dribbled like any <br />
lively purliteasy: <em>My, my, my! Me and me! Little down dream <br />
don’t I love thee!</em></p>

<p>And, I declare, what was there on the yonder bank of the <br />
stream that would be a river, parched on a limb of the olum, bolt <br />
downright, but the Gripes? And no doubt he was fit to be dried <br />
for why had he not been having the juice of his times?</p>

<p>His pips had been neatly all drowned on him; his polps were <br />
charging odours every older minute; he was quickly for getting <br />
the dresser’s desdaign on the flyleaf of his frons; and he was <br />
quietly for giving the bailiff’s distrain on to the bulkside of his <br />

mus Maximus, the Mookse had never seen his Dubville brooder- <br />
on-low so nigh to a pickle.</p>
