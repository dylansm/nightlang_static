<p>And they viterberated each other, <em>canis et coluber</em> with the <br />
wildest ever wielded since Tarriestinus lashed Pissasphaltium.

<p>And bullfolly answered volleyball.</p>

<p>Nuvoletta in her lightdress, spunn of sisteen shimmers, was <br />
looking down on them, leaning over the bannistars and listening <br />
all she childishly could. How she was brightened when Should- <br />
rups in his glaubering hochskied his welkinstuck and how she <br />
was overclused when Kneesknobs on his zwivvel was makeact- <br />
ing such a paulse of himshelp! She was alone. All her nubied <br />
companions were asleeping with the squirrels. Their mivver, <br />
Mrs Moonan, was off in the Fuerst quarter scrubbing the back- <br />
steps of Number 28. Fuvver, that Skand, he was up in Norwood’s <br />
sokaparlour, eating oceans of Voking’s Blemish. Nuvoletta lis- <br />
tened as she reflected herself, though the heavenly one with his <br />
constellatria and his emanations stood between, and she tried all <br />
she tried to make the Mookse look up at her (but <em>he</em> was fore too <br />
adiaptotously farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how coy <br />
she could be (though he was much too schystimatically auricular <br />
about <em>his ens</em> to heed her) but it was all mild’s vapour moist. Not <br />
even her feignt reflection, Nuvoluccia, could they toke their <br />
gnoses off for their minds with intrepifide fate and bungless <br />
curiasity, were conclaved with Heliogobbleus and Commodus <br />
and Enobarbarus and whatever the coordinal dickens they did <br />
as their damprauch of papyrs and buchstubs said. As if that was <br />
their spiration! As if theirs could duiparate her queendim! As if <br />
she would be third perty to search on search proceedings! She <br />
tried all the winsome wonsome ways her four winds had taught <br />
her. She tossed her sfumastelliacinous hair like <em>la princesse de la <br />
Petite Bretagne</em> and she rounded her mignons arms like Mrs <br />
Cornwallis-West and she smiled over herself like the beauty of <br />
the image of the pose of the daughter of the queen of the Em- <br />
perour of Irelande and she sighed after herself as were she born<span></span></p>
