<p class="ni">to bride with Tristis Tristior Tristissimus. But, sweet madonine, <br />
she might fair as well have carried her daisy’s worth to Florida. <br />
For the Mookse, a dogmad Accanite, were not amoosed and the <br />
Gripes, a dubliboused Catalick, wis pinefully obliviscent.</p>

<p>I see, she sighed. There are menner.</p>

<p>The siss of the whisp of the sigh of the softzing at the stir of <br />
the ver grose O arundo of a long one in midias reeds: and shades <br />
began to glidder along the banks, greepsing, greepsing, duusk <br />
unto duusk, and it was as glooming as gloaming could be in the <br />
waste of all peacable worlds. Metamnisia was allsoonome coloro- <br />
form brune; citherior spiane an eaulande, innemorous and un- <br />
numerose. The Mookse had a sound eyes right but he could not <br />
all hear. The Gripes had light ears left yet he could but ill see. <br />
He ceased. And he ceased, tung and trit, and it was neversoever <br />
so dusk of both of them. But still Moo thought on the deeps of <br />
the undths he would profoundth come the morrokse and still <br />
Gri feeled of the scripes he would escipe if by grice he had luck <br />
enoupes.</p>

<p>Oh, how it was duusk! From Vallee Maraia to Grasyaplaina, <br />
dormimust echo! Ah dew! Ah dew! It was so duusk that the <br />
tears of night began to fall, first by ones and twos, then by threes <br />
and fours, at last by fives and sixes of sevens, for the tired ones <br />
were wecking, as we weep now with them. <em>O! O! O! Par la <br />
pluie!</em></p>

<p>Then there came down to the thither bank a woman of no <br />
appearance (I believe she was a Black with chills at her feet) and <br />
she gathered up his hoariness the Mookse motamourfully where <br />
he was spread and carried him away to her invisible dwelling, <br />
thats hights, <em>Aquila Rapax</em>, for he was the holy sacred solem and <br />
poshup spit of her boshop’s apron. So you see the Mookse he <br />
had reason as I knew and you knew and he knew all along. And <br />
there came down to the hither bank a woman to all important <br />
(though they say that she was comely, spite the cold in her heed) <br />
and, for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker’s hank, she <br />
plucked down the Gripes, torn panicky autotone, in angeu from <br />
his limb and cariad away its beotitubes with her to her unseen<span></span></p>
