<p class="ni">shieling, it is, <em>De Rore Coeli</em>. And so the poor Gripes got wrong; <br />
for that is always how a Gripes is, always was and always will.be. <br />
And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were <br />
left now an only elmtree and but a stone. Polled with pietrous, <br />
Sierre but saule. O! Yes! And Nuvoletta, a lass.</p>

<p>Then Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life <br />
and she made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one. She <br />
cancelled all her engauzements. She climbed over the bannistars; <br />
she gave a childy cloudy cry: <em>Nuée! Nuée!</em> A lightdress fluttered. <br />
She was gone. And into the river that had been a stream (for a <br />
thousand of tears had gone eon her and come on her and she was <br />
stout and struck on dancing and her muddied name was Missis- <br />
liffi) there fell a tear, a singult tear, the loveliest of all tears (I <br />
mean for those crylove fables fans who are ‘keen’ on the pretty- <br />
pretty commonface sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods) for it <br />
was a leaptear. But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping <br />
as though her heart was brook: <em>Why, why, why! Weh, O weh <br />
I’se so silly to be flowing but I no canna stay!</em></p>

<p>No applause, please! Bast! The romescot nattleshaker will go <br />
round your circulation in <em>diu dursus</em>.</p>

<p>Allaboy, Major, I’ll take your reactions in another place after <br />
themes. Nolan Browne, you may now leave the classroom. Joe <br />
Peters, Fox.</p>

<p>As I have now successfully explained to you my own natural- <br />
born rations which are even in excise of my vaultybrain insure <br />
me that I am a mouth’s more deserving case by genius. I feel in <br />
symbathos for my ever devoted friend and halfaloafonwashed, <br />
Gnaccus Gnoccovitch. Darling gem! Darling smallfox! Horose- <br />
shoew! I could love that man like my own ambo for being so <br />
baileycliaver though he’s a nawful curillass and I must slav to <br />
methodiousness. I want him to go and live like a theabild in <br />
charge of the night brigade on Tristan da Cunha, isle of man- <br />
overboard, where he’ll make Number 106 and be near Inacces- <br />
sible. (The meeting of mahoganies, be the waves, rementious <br />
