%ni%michelangelines have fooled to dread I proved to mindself as to  
your sotisfiction how his abject all through (the *quickquid* of Pro-  
fessor Ciondolone’s too frequently hypothecated *Bettlermensch*)  
is nothing so much more than a mere cashdime however genteel  
he may want ours, if we please (I am speaking to us in the second  
person), for to this graded intellecktuals dime *is* cash and the  
cash system (you must not be allowed to forget that this is all  
contained, I mean the system, in the dogmarks of origen on  
spurios) means that I cannot now have or nothave a piece of  
cheeps in your pocket at the same time and with the same man-  
ners as you can now nothalf or half the cheek apiece I’ve in mind  
unless Burrus and Caseous have not or not have seemaultaneous-  
ly sysentangled themselves, selldear to soldthere, once in the

suppy, (ah who! eh how!) in Acetius and Oleosus and Sellius  
Volatilis and Petrus Papricus! Our Old Party quite united round  
the Slatbowel at Commons: Pfarrer Salamoss himself and that  
sprog of a Pedersill and his Sprig of Thyme and a dozen of the  
Murphybuds and a score and more of the hot young Capels and  
Lettucia in her greensleeves and you too and me three, twinsome  
bibs but hansome ates, like shakespill and eggs! But there’s many  
a split pretext bowl and jowl; and (snob screwing that cork,  
Schott!) to understand this as well as you can, feeling how back-  
ward you are in your down-to-the-ground benches, I have com-  
pleted the following arrangement for the coarse use of stools and
