<p>The older sisars (Tyrants, regicide is too good for you!) be- <br />
come unbeurrable from age, (the compositor of the farce of <br />
dustiny however makes a thunpledrum mistake by letting off this <br />
pienofarte effect as his furst act as that is where the juke comes <br />
in) having been sort-of-nineknived and chewly removed (this <br />
soldier - author - batman for all his commontoryism is just <br />
another of those souftsiezed bubbles who never quite got the <br />
sandhurst out of his eyes so that the champaign he draws for us <br />
is as flop as a plankrieg) the twinfreer types are billed to make <br />
their reupprearance as the knew kneck and knife knickknots on <br />
the deserted <em>champ de bouteilles</em>. (A most cursery reading into the <br />
Persic-Uraliens hostery shows us how Fonnumagula picked <br />
up that propper numen out of a colluction of prifixes though <br />
to the permienting cannasure the Coucousien oafsprung of this <br />
sun of a kuk is as sattin as there’s a tub in Tobolosk) <em>Ostiak <br />
della Vogul Marina!</em> But that I dannoy the fact of wanton to <br />
weste point I could paint you to that butter (cheese it!) if you <br />
had some wash. Mordvealive! Oh me none onsens! Why the <br />
case is as inessive and impossive as kezom hands! Their inter- <br />
locative is conprovocative just as every hazzy hates to having a <br />
hazbane in her noze. Caseous may bethink himself a thought of <br />
a caviller but Burrus has the reachly roundered head that goes <br />
best with thofthinking defensive fideism. He has the lac of wis- <br />
dom under every dent in his lofter while the other follow’s <br />
onni vesy milky indeedmymy. Laughing over the linnuts and <br />
weeping off the uniun. He hisn’t the hey og he lisn’t the lug, <br />
poohoo. And each night sim misses mand he winks he had the <br />
semagen. It was aptly and corrigidly stated (and, it is royally <br />
needless for one <em>ex ungue Leonem</em> to say by whom) that his <br />
seeingscraft was that clarety as were the wholeborough of Poutres- <br />
bourg to be averlaunched over him pitchbatch he could still make <br />
out with his augstritch the green moat in Ireland’s Eye. Let me <br />
sell you the fulltroth of Burrus when he wore a younker. Here <br />
it is, and chorming too, in six by sevens! A cleanly line, by the <br />
gods! A king off duty and a jaw for ever! And what a cheery <br />
ripe outlook, good help me Deus v Deus! If I were to speak<span></span></p>
