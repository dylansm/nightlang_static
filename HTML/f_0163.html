<p class="ni">my ohole mouthful to arinam about it you should call me the <br />
ormuzd aliment in your midst of faime. Eat ye up, heat ye up! <br />
sings the somun in the salm. <em>Butyrum et mel comedet ut sciat <br />
reprobare malum et eligere bonum.</em> This, of course, also explains <br />
why we were taught to play in the childhood: <em>Der Haensli ist <br />
ern Butterbrot, mein Butterbrot! Und Koebi iss dein Schtinkenkot! <br />
Ja! Ja! Ja!</em></p>

<p>This in fact, just to show you, is Caseous, the brutherscutch <br />
or puir tyron: a hole or two, the highstinks aforefelt and anygo <br />
prigging wurms. Cheesugh! you complain. And Hi Hi High <br />
must say you are not Hoa Hoa Hoally in the wrong!</p>

<p>Thus we cannot escape our likes and mislikes, exiles or am- <br />
busheers, beggar and neighbour and<span class="em">—</span>this is where the dime- <br />
show advertisers advance the temporal relief plea<span class="em">—</span>let us be <br />

of the Cusanus philosophism in which old Nicholas pegs it <br />
down that the smarter the spin of the top the sounder the span <br />
of the buttom (what the worthy old auberginiste ought to have <br />
meant was: the more stolidly immobile <em>in space</em> appears to me <br />
the bottom which is presented to use in time by the top primo- <br />
mobilisk &amp;c.). And I shall be misunderstord if understood to <br />
give an unconditional sinequam to the heroicised furibouts of <br />
the Nolanus theory, or, at any rate, of that substrate of apart <br />
from hissheory where the Theophil swoors that on principial he <br />
was the pointing start of his odiose by comparison and that whiles <br />
eggs will fall cheapened all over the walled the Bure will be dear <br />
on the Brie.</p>

<p>Now, while I am not out now to be taken up as unintention- <br />
ally recommending the Silkebjorg tyrondynamon machine for <br />
the more economical helixtrolysis of these amboadipates until <br />
I can find space to look into it myself a little more closely first <br />
I shall go on with my decisions after having shown to you in <br />
good time how both products of our social stomach (the excellent <br />
Dr Burroman, I noticed by the way from his emended food <br />
