<p class="ni">I helped him to in my princeps edition which is all so munch <br />
to the cud) are mutuearly polarised the incompatabilily of any <br />
delusional acting as ambivalent to the fixation of his pivotism. <br />
Positing, as above, too males pooles, the one the pictor of the <br />
other and the omber the <em>Skotia</em> of the one, and looking want- <br />
ingly around our undistributed middle between males we feel <br />
we must waistfully woent a female to focus and on this stage <br />
there pleasantly appears the cowrymaid M. whom we shall <br />
often meet below who introduces herself upon us at some precise <br />
hour which we shall again agree to call absolute zero or the <br />
babbling pumpt of platinism. And so like that former son <br />
of a kish who went up and out to found his farmer’s ashes we <br />
come down home gently on our own turnedabout asses to meet <br />
Margareen.</p>

<p>We now romp through a period of pure lyricism of shame- <br />
bred music (technologically, let me say, the appetising entry of <br />
this subject on a fool chest of vialds is plumply pudding the carp <br />
before doevre hors) evidenced by such words in distress as <em>I <br />
cream for thee, Sweet Margareen</em>, and the more hopeful <em>O Mar- <br />
gareena! O Margareena! Still in the bowl is left a lump of gold!</em> <br />
(Correspondents, by the way, will keep on asking me what is the <br />
correct garnish to serve drisheens with. Tansy Sauce. Enough). <br />
The pawnbreaking pathos of the first of these shoddy pieces <br />
reveals it as a Caseous effort. Burrus’s bit is often used for a toast. <br />
Criniculture can tell us very precisely indeed how and why this <br />
particular streak of yellow silver first appeared on (not in) the <br />
bowel, that is to see, the human head, bald, black, bronze, brown, <br />
brindled, betteraved or blanchemanged where it might be use- <br />
fully compared with an earwig on a fullbottom. I am offering <br />
this to Signorina Cuticura and I intend to take it up and bring it <br />
under the nosetice of Herr Harlene by way of diverting his <br />
attentions. Of course the unskilled singer continues to pervert <br />
our wiser ears by subordinating the space-element, that is to <br />
sing, the <em>aria</em>, to the time-factor, which ought to be killed, <em>ill <br />
tempor</em>. I should advise any unborn singer who may still be <br />
among my heeders to forget her temporal diaphragm at home<span></span></p>
