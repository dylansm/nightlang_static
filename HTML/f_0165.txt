with a swift *colpo di glottide* to the lug (though Maace I will  
insist was reclined from overdoing this, his recovery often being  
slow) and then, O! on the third dead beat, O! to cluse her eyes  
and aiopen her oath and see what spice I may send her. How?  
Cease thee, cantatrickee! I fain would be solo. Arouse thee, my  
valour! And save for e’er my true Bdur!

I shall have a word to say in a few yards about the acoustic  
and orchidectural management of the tonehall but, as ours is a  
vivarious where one plant’s breaf is a lunger planner’s byscent  
and you may not care for argon, it will be very convenient for  
me for the emolument to pursue Burrus and Caseous for a rung  
or two up their isocelating biangle. Every admirer has seen my  
goulache of Marge (she is *so* like the sister, you don’t know, and  
they both dress A L I K E !) which I titled *The Very Picture of  
a Needlesswoman* which in the presence ornates our national  
cruetstand. This genre of portraiture of changes of mind in order  
to be truly torse should evoke the bush soul of females so I am  
leaving it to the experienced victim to complete the general  
suggestion by the mental addition of a wallopy bound or, should  
the zulugical zealot prefer it, a congorool teal. The hatboxes  
which composed Rhomba, lady Trabezond (Marge in her *ex-  
celsis*), also comprised the climactogram up which B and C may  
fondly be imagined ascending and are suggestive of gentlemen’s  
spring modes, these modes carrying us back to the superimposed  
claylayers of eocene and pleastoseen formation and the gradual  
morphological changes in our body politic which Professor

about fourpence pourbox but I am inventing a more patent pro-

Homes person who is out for removing the roofs of our criminal  
classics by what *deductio ad domunum* he hopes *de tacto* to detect  
anything unless he happens of himself, *movibile tectu*, to have a
