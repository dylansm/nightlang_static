<p class="ni">true crust by even the youngest of Margees if she will take plase <br />
to be seated and smile if I please.</p>

<p>Now there can be no question about it either that I having <br />
done as much, have quite got the size of that demilitery young <br />
female (we will continue to call her Marge) whose types may be <br />
met with in any public garden, wearing a very “dressy” affair, <br />
known as an “ethel” of instep length and with a real fur, reduced <br />
to 3/9, and muffin cap to tone (they are “angelskin” this fall), <br />
ostentatiously hemming apologetically over the shirtness of <br />
some “sweet” garment, when she is not sitting on all the free <br />
benches avidously reading about “it” but ovidently on the look <br />
out for “him” or so “thrilled” about the best dressed dolly pram <br />
and beautiful elbow competition or at the movies swallowing <br />
sobs and blowing bixed mixcuits over “childe” chaplain’s “latest” <br />
or on the verge of the gutter with some bobbedhair brieffrocked <br />
babyma’s toddler (the Smythe-Smythes now keep TWO domes- <br />
tics and aspire to THREE male ones, a shover, a butlegger and <br />
a sectary) held hostage at armslength, teaching His Infant <br />
Majesty how to make waters worse.</p>

<p>(I am closely watching Master Pules, as I have regions to sus- <br />
pect from my post that her “little man” is a secondary school- <br />
teacher under the boards of education, a voted disciple of Infan- <br />
tulus who is being utilised thus publicly by the <em>seducente infanta</em> <br />
to conceal her own more mascular personality by flaunting <br />
frivolish finery over men’s inside clothes, for the femininny of <br />
that totamulier will always lack the musculink of a verumvirum. <br />
My solotions for the proper parturience of matres and the edu- <br />
cation of micturious mites must stand over from the moment till <br />
I tackle this tickler hussy for occupying my uttentions.)</p>

<p>Margareena she’s very fond of Burrus but, alick and alack! <br />
she velly fond of chee. (The important influence exercised on <br />
everything by this eastasian import has not been till now fully <br />
flavoured though we can comfortably taste it in this case. I shall <br />
come back for a little more say farther on.) A cleopatrician in <br />
her own right she at once complicates the position while Burrus <br />
and Caseous are contending for her misstery by implicating her-<span></span></p>
