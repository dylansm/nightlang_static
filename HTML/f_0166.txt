%ni%true crust by even the youngest of Margees if she will take plase  
to be seated and smile if I please.

Now there can be no question about it either that I having  
done as much, have quite got the size of that demilitery young  
female (we will continue to call her Marge) whose types may be  
met with in any public garden, wearing a very “dressy” affair,  
known as an “ethel” of instep length and with a real fur, reduced  
to 3/9, and muffin cap to tone (they are “angelskin” this fall),  
ostentatiously hemming apologetically over the shirtness of  
some “sweet” garment, when she is not sitting on all the free  
benches avidously reading about “it” but ovidently on the look

to conceal her own more mascular personality by flaunting  
frivolish finery over men’s inside clothes, for the femininny of  
that totamulier will always lack the musculink of a verumvirum.  
My solotions for the proper parturience of matres and the edu-  
cation of micturious mites must stand over from the moment till  
I tackle this tickler hussy for occupying my uttentions.)

Margareena she’s very fond of Burrus but, alick and alack!  
she velly fond of chee. (The important influence exercised on  
everything by this eastasian import has not been till now fully  
flavoured though we can comfortably taste it in this case. I shall  
come back for a little more say farther on.) A cleopatrician in  
her own right she at once complicates the position while Burrus  
and Caseous are contending for her misstery by implicating her-%j%
