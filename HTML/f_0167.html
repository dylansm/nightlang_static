<p class="ni">self with an elusive Antonius, a wop who would appear to hug <br />
a personal interest in refined chees of all chades at the same time <br />
as he wags an antomine art of being rude like the boor. This <br />
Antonius-Burrus-Caseous grouptriad may be said to equate <br />
the <em>qualis</em> equivalent with the older socalled <em>talis</em> on <em>talis</em> one <br />
just as quantly as in the hyperchemical economantarchy the tan- <br />
tum ergons irruminate the quantum urge so that eggs is to whey <br />
as whay is to zeed like your golfchild’s abe boob caddy. And this <br />
is why any simple philadolphus of a fool you like to dress, an <br />
athemisthued lowtownian, exlegged phatrisight, may be awfully <br />
green to one side of him and fruitfully blue on the other which <br />
will not screen him however from appealing to my gropesarch- <br />
ing eyes, through the strongholes of my acropoll, as a boosted <br />
blasted bleating blatant bloaten blasphorus blesphorous idiot <br />
who kennot tail a bomb from a painapple when he steals one <br />
and wannot psing his psalmen with the cong in our gregational <br />
pompoms with the canting crew.</p>

<p>No! Topsman to your Tarpeia! This thing, Mister Abby, is <br />
nefand. (And, taking off soutstuffs and alkalike matters, I hope <br />
we can kill time to reach the salt because there’s some forceglass <br />
neutric assets bittering in the soldpewter for you to plump your <br />
pottage in). The thundering legion has stormed Olymp that <br />
it end. Twelve tabular times till now have I edicted it. Merus <br />
Genius to Careous Caseous! <em>Moriture, te salutat!</em> My phemous <br />
themis race is run, so let Demoncracy take the highmost! (Abra- <br />
ham Tripier. Those old diligences are quite out of date. Read <br />
next answer). I’ll beat you so lon. (Bigtempered. Why not take <br />
direct action. See previous reply). My unchanging Word is sacred. <br />
The word is my Wife, to exponse and expound, to vend and to <br />
velnerate, and may the curlews crown our nuptias! Till Breath <br />
us depart! Wamen. Beware would you change with my years. Be <br />
as young as your grandmother! The ring man in the rong shop <br />
but the rite words by the rote order! <em>Ubi lingua nuncupassit, ibi <br />
fas! Adversus hostem semper sac!</em> She that will not feel my ful- <br />
moon let her peel to thee as the hoyden and the impudent! That <br />
mon that hoth no moses in his sole nor is not awed by conquists<span></span></p>
