his soil to lave his head, when his hope’s in his highlows from <br />
whisking his woe, if he came to my preach, a proud pursebroken <br />

were we bread by the same fire and signed with the same salt, <br />
had we tapped from the same master and robbed the same till, <br />
were we tucked in the one bed and bit by the one flea, homo- <br />
gallant and hemycapnoise, bum and dingo, jack by churl, though <br />
it broke my heart to pray it, still I’d fear I’d hate to say!</p>
