Old Zealand! he could not attouch it. See what happens when <br />
your somatophage merman takes his fancy to our virgitarian <br />

saying he would far sooner muddle through the hash of lentils <br />
in Europe than meddle with Irrland’s split little pea. Once when <br />
among those rebels in a state of hopelessly helpless intoxication <br />
the piscivore strove to lift a czitround peel to either nostril, hic- <br />
cupping, apparently impromptued by the hibat he had with his <br />
glottal stop, that he kukkakould flowrish for ever by the smell, <br />
as the czitr, as the kcedron, like a scedar, of the founts, on moun- <br />

Aint that swell, hey? Peamengro! Talk about lowness! Any <br />
