the simple worf and plague and poison they had cornered him <br />
about until there was not a snoozer among them but was utterly <br />
undeceived in the heel of the reel by the recital of the rigmarole.</p>

<p>He went without saying that the cull disliked anything anyway <br />
approaching a plain straightforward standup or knockdown row <br />
and, as often as he was called in to umpire any octagonal argu- <br />
ment among slangwhangers, the accomplished washout always <br />
used to rub shoulders with the last speaker and clasp shakers (the <br />
handtouch which is speech without words) and agree to every <br />
word as soon as half uttered, command me!, your servant, good, <br />
I revere you, how, my seer? be drinking that! quite truth, grati- <br />
as, I’m yoush, see wha’m hearing?, also goods, please it, me <br />

anything in the world he could do to please him and to overflow <br />

One hailcannon night (for his departure was attended by a <br />
heavy downpour) as very recently as some thousand rains ago he <br />
was therefore treated with what closely resembled parsonal viol- <br />

of Tumblin-on-the-Leafy from Mr Vanhomrigh’s house at 81 <em>bis</em> <br />
Mabbot’s Mall as far as Green Patch beyond the brickfields of <br />
Salmon Pool by rival teams of slowspiers counter quicklimers <br />
who finally, as rahilly they had been deteened out rawther lae- <br />

home after their Auborne-to-Auborne, with thanks for the pleasant <br />
evening, one and all disgustedly, instead of ruggering him back, <br />
and awake, reconciled (though they were as jealous as could be <br />
cullions about all the truffles they had brought on him) to a <br />
friendship, fast and furious, which merely arose out of the noxious <br />
