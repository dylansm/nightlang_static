He went without saying that the cull disliked anything anyway  
approaching a plain straightforward standup or knockdown row  
and, as often as he was called in to umpire any octagonal argu-

used to rub shoulders with the last speaker and clasp shakers (the  
handtouch which is speech without words) and agree to every  
word as soon as half uttered, command me!, your servant, good,
