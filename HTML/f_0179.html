life when he found himself (<em>hic sunt lennones!</em>) at pointblank <br />
range blinking down the barrel of an irregular revolver of <br />
the bulldog with a purpose pattern, handled by an unknown <br />
quarreler who, supposedly, had been told off to shade and <br />

awhile to look facts in their face before being hosed and creased <br />
(uprip and jack him!) by six or a dozen of the gayboys.</p>

litany of septuncial lettertrumpets honorific, highpitched, erudite, <br />

his name. It would have diverted, if ever seen, the shuddersome <br />
spectacle of this semidemented zany amid the inspissated grime <br />
