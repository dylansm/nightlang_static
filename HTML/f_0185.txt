sell, the pulpic dictators, on the nudgment of their legal advisers,  
Messrs Codex and Podex, and under his own benefiction of their  
pastor Father Flammeus Falconer, boycotted him of all mutton-  
suet candles and romeruled stationery for any purpose, he winged  
away on a wildgoup’s chase across the kathartic ocean and made  
synthetic ink and sensitive paper for his own end out of his wit’s

*demum ex stercore turpi cum divi Orionis iucunditate mixto, cocto,  
frigorique exposito, encaustum sibi fecit indelibile* (faked O’Ryan’s,

Then, pious Eneas, conformant to thc fulminant firman which  
enjoins on the tremylose terrian that, when the call comes, he  
shall produce nichthemerically from his unheavenly body a no  
uncertain quantity of obscene matter not protected by copriright
