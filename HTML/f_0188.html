<p class="ni">all the morning since your last wetbed confession? I advise you <br />
to conceal yourself, my little friend, as I have said a moment <br />
ago and put your hands in my hands and have a nightslong <br />
homely little confiteor about things. Let me see. It is looking <br />
pretty black against you, we suggest, Sheem avick. You will <br />
need all the elements in the river to clean you over it all and a <br />
fortifine popespriestpower bull of attender to booth.</p>

<p>Let us pry. We thought, would and did. <em>Cur, quicquid, ubi, <br />
quando, quomodo, quoties, quibus auxiliis?</em> You were bred, fed, <br />
fostered and fattened from holy childhood up in this two easter <br />
island on the piejaw of hilarious heaven and roaring the other <br />
place (plunders to night of you, blunders what’s left of you, flash <br />
as flash can!) and now, forsooth, a nogger among the blankards <br />
of this dastard century, you have become of twosome twiminds <br />
forenenst gods, hidden and discovered, nay, condemned fool, <br />
anarch, egoarch, hiresiarch, you have reared your disunited king- <br />
dom on the vacuum of your own most intensely doubtful soul. <br />
Do you hold yourself then for some god in the manger, Sheho- <br />
hem, that you will neither serve not let serve, pray nor let pray? <br />
And here, pay the piety, must I too nerve myself to pray for the <br />
loss of selfrespect to equip me for the horrible necessity of scan- <br />
dalisang (my dear sisters, are you ready?) by sloughing off my <br />
hope and tremors while we all swin together in the pool of So- <br />
dom? I shall shiver for my purity while they will weepbig for <br />
your sins. Away with covered words, new Solemonities for old <br />
Badsheetbaths! That inharmonious detail, did you name it? Cold <br />
caldor! Gee! Victory! Now, opprobro of underslung pipes, <br />
johnjacobs, while yet an adolescent (what do I say?), while <br />
still puerile in your tubsuit with buttonlegs, you got a hand- <br />
some present of a selfraising syringe and twin feeders (you know, <br />
Monsieur Abgott, in your art of arts, to your cost as well as I do <br />
(and don’t try to hide it) the penals lots I am now poking at) and <br />
the wheeze sort of was you should (if you were as bould a stroke <br />
now as the curate that christened you, sonny douth-the-candle!) <br />
repopulate the land of your birth and count up your progeny by <br />
the hungered head and the angered thousand but you thwarted<span></span></p>
