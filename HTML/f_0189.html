<p class="ni">the wious pish of your cogodparents, soph, among countless <br />
occasions of failing (for, said you, I will elenchate), adding to the <br />
malice of your transgression, yes, and changing its nature, (you <br />
see I have read your theology for you) alternating the morosity <br />
of my delectations<span class="em">—</span>a philtred love, trysting by tantrums, <br />
small peace in ppenmark<span class="em">—</span>with sensibility, sponsibility, passi- <br />
bility and prostability, your lubbock’s other fear pleasures of a <br />
butler’s life, even extruding your strabismal apologia, when <br />
legibly depressed, upon defenceless paper and thereby adding to <br />
the already unhappiness of this our popeyed world, scribblative! <br />
<span class="em">—</span>all that too with cantreds of countless catchaleens, the man- <br />
nish as many as the minneful, congested around and about you <br />
for acres and roods and poles or perches, thick as the fluctuant <br />
sands of Chalwador, accomplished women, indeed fully edu- <br />
canded, far from being old and rich behind their dream of arri- <br />
visme, if they have only their honour left, and not deterred by bad <br />
weather when consumed by amorous passion, struggling to pos- <br />
sess themselves of your boosh, one son of Sorge for all daughters <br />
of Anguish, <em>solus cum sola sive cuncties cum omnibobs</em> (I’d have <br />
been the best man for you, myself), mutely aying for hat natural <br />
knot, debituary vases or vessels preposterous, for what would <br />
not have cost you ten bolivars of collarwork or the price of one <br />
ping pang, just a lilt, let us trillt, of the oldest song in the wooed <br />
woodworld, (two-we! to-one!), accompanied by a plain gold <br />
band! Hail! Hail! Highbosomheaving Missmisstress Morna of <br />
the allsweetheartening bridemuredemeanour! Her eye’s so glad- <br />
some we’ll all take shares in the <span class="em">——</span>groom!</p>

<p>Sniffer of carrion, premature gravedigger, seeker of the nest <br />
of evil in the bosom of a good word, you, who sleep at our vigil <br />
and fast for our feast, you with your dislocated reason, have <br />
cutely foretold, a jophet in your own absence, by blind poring <br />
upon your many scalds and burns and blisters, impetiginous sore <br />
and pustules, by the auspices of that raven cloud, your shade, and <br />
by the auguries of rooks in parlament, death with every disaster, <br />
the dynamitisation of colleagues, the reducing of records to <br />
ashes, the levelling of all customs by blazes, the return of a lot<span></span></p>
