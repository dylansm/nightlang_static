%ni%the wious pish of your cogodparents, soph, among countless  
occasions of failing (for, said you, I will elenchate), adding to the  
malice of your transgression, yes, and changing its nature, (you  
see I have read your theology for you) alternating the morosity  
of my delectations%—%a philtred love, trysting by tantrums,  
small peace in ppenmark%—%with sensibility, sponsibility, passi-  
bility and prostability, your lubbock’s other fear pleasures of a  
butler’s life, even extruding your strabismal apologia, when  
legibly depressed, upon defenceless paper and thereby adding to  
the already unhappiness of this our popeyed world, scribblative!

for acres and roods and poles or perches, thick as the fluctuant

Sniffer of carrion, premature gravedigger, seeker of the nest  
of evil in the bosom of a good word, you, who sleep at our vigil  
and fast for our feast, you with your dislocated reason, have  
cutely foretold, a jophet in your own absence, by blind poring  
upon your many scalds and burns and blisters, impetiginous sore  
and pustules, by the auspices of that raven cloud, your shade, and  
by the auguries of rooks in parlament, death with every disaster,  
the dynamitisation of colleagues, the reducing of records to  
ashes, the levelling of all customs by blazes, the return of a lot%j%
