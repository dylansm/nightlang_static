funeral! O pest, I’ll miss the post!) that the more carrots you <br />
chop, the more turnips you slit, the more murphies you peel, the <br />
more onions you cry over, the more bullbeef you butch, the <br />
more mutton you crackerhack, the more potherbs you pound, <br />

<p>O, by the way, yes, another thing occurs to me. You let me tell <br />
you, with the utmost politeness, were very ordinarily designed, <br />
your birthwrong was, to fall in with Plan, as our nationals <br />
should, as all nationists must, and do a certain office (what, I will <br />
not tell you) in a certain holy office (nor will I say where) during <br />
certain agonising office hours (a clerical party all to yourself) from <br />
such a year to such an hour on such and such a date at so and <br />
so much a week <em>pro anno</em> (Guinness’s, may I remind, were just <br />
agulp for you, failing in which you might have taken the scales off <br />
boilers like any boskop of Yorek) and do your little thruppenny <br />
bit and thus earn from the nation true thanks, right here in our <br />

after a divine’s prodigence you drew the first watergasp in your <br />
life, from the crib where you once was bit to the crypt you’ll <br />
be twice as shy of, same as we, long of us, alone with the colt <br />
in the curner, where you were as popular as an armenial with <br />
the faithful, and you set fire to my tailcoat when I hold the <br />
paraffin smoker under yours (I hope that chimney’s clear) but, <br />
slackly shirking both your bullet and your billet, you beat it <br />
backwards like Boulanger from Galway (but he combed the grass <br />
against his stride) to sing us a song of alibi, (the cuthone call over <br />
the greybounding slowrolling amplyheaving metamorphoseous <br />
that oozy rocks parapangle their preposters with) nomad, mooner <br />
by lamplight, antinos, shemming amid everyone’s repressed <br />
laughter to conceal your scatchophily by mating, like a thorough- <br />
paste prosodite, masculine monosyllables of the same numerical <br />
