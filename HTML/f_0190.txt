funeral! O pest, I’ll miss the post!) that the more carrots you  
chop, the more turnips you slit, the more murphies you peel, the  
more onions you cry over, the more bullbeef you butch, the  
more mutton you crackerhack, the more potherbs you pound,

O, by the way, yes, another thing occurs to me. You let me tell  
you, with the utmost politeness, were very ordinarily designed,
