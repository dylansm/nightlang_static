<p class="ni">sixpenny stile, an unfrillfrocked quackfriar, you (will you for <br />
the laugh of Scheekspair just help mine with the epithet?) semi- <br />
semitic serendipitist, you (thanks, I think that describes you) <br />
Europasianised Afferyank!</p>

<p>Shall we follow each others a steplonger, drowner of daggers, <br />
whiles our liege, tilyet a stranger in the frontyard of his happi- <br />
ness, is taking, (heal helper! one gob, one gap, one gulp and <br />
gorger of all!) his refreshment?</p>

<p>There grew up beside you, amid our orisons of the speediest. <br />
in Novena Lodge, Novara Avenue, in Patripodium-am-Bummel, <br />
oaf, outofwork, one remove from an unwashed savage, on his <br />
keeping and in yours, (I pose you know why possum hides is <br />
cause he haint the nogumtreeumption) that other, Immaculatus, <br />
from head to foot, sir, that pure one, Altrues of other times, <br />
he who was well known to celestine circles before he sped <br />
aloft, our handsome young spiritual physician that was to be, <br />
seducing every sense to selfwilling celebesty, the most winning <br />
counterfeuille on our incomeshare lotetree, a chum of the <br />
angelets, a youth those reporters so pettitily wanted as game- <br />
fellow that they asked his mother for ittle earps brupper to <br />
let him tome to Tindertarten? pease, and bing his scooter <br />
’long and ’tend they were all real brothers in the big justright <br />
home where Dodd lives, just to teddyfy the life out of him <br />
and pat and pass him one with other like musk from hand to <br />
hand, that mothersmothered model, that goodlooker with not <br />
a flaw whose spiritual toilettes were the talk of half the town, for <br />
sunset wear and nightfallen use and daybroken donning and <br />
nooncheon showing and the very thing for teasetime, but him <br />
you laid low with one hand one fine May morning in the Meddle <br />
of your Might, your bosom foe, because he mussed your speller <br />
on you or because he cut a pretty figure in the focus of your <br />
frontispecs (not one did you slay, no, but a continent!) to find <br />
out how his innards worked!</p>

<p>Ever read of that greatgrand landfather of our visionbuilders, <br />
Baaboo, the bourgeoismeister, who thought to touch both him- <br />
mels at the punt of his risen stiffstaff and how wishywashy sank<span></span></p>
