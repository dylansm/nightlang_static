<p class="ni">making) you squandered among underlings the overload of <br />
your extravagance and made a hottentot of dulpeners crawsick <br />
with your crumbs? Am I not right? Yes? Yes? Yes? Holy wax <br />
and holifer! Don’t tell me, Leon of the fold, that you are not a <br />
loanshark! Look up, old sooty, be advised by mux and take your <br />
medicine. The Good Doctor mulled it. Mix it twice before re- <br />
pastures and powder three times a day. It does marvels for your <br />
gripins and it’s fine for the solitary worm.</p>

<p>Let me finish! Just a little judas tonic, my ghem of all jokes, to <br />
make you go green in the gazer. Do you hear what I’m seeing, <br />
hammet? And remember that golden silence gives consent, Mr <br />
Anklegazer! Cease to be civil, learn to say nay! Whisht! Come <br />
here, Herr Studiosus, till I tell you a wig in your ear. We’ll do a <br />
whisper drive, for if the barishnyas got a twitter of it they’d tell <br />
the housetops and then all Cadbury would go crackers. Look! <br />
Do you see your dial in the rockingglass? Look well! Bend down <br />
a stigmy till I! It’s secret! Iggri, I say, the booseleers! I had it <br />
from Lamppost Shawe. And he had it from the Mullah. And Mull <br />
took it from a Bluecoat schooler. And Gay Socks jot it from <br />
Potapheu’s wife. And Rantipoll tipped the wink from old Mrs <br />
Tinbullet. And as for she was confussed by pro-Brother Thaco- <br />
licus. And the good brother feels he would need to defecate <br />
you. And the Flimsy Follettes are simply beside each other. <br />
And Kelly, Kenny and Keogh are up up and in arms. That a <br />
cross may crush me if I refuse to believe in it. That I may rock <br />
anchor through the ages if I hope it’s not true. That the host <br />
may choke me if I beneighbour you without my charity! Sh! <br />
Shem, you are. Sh! You are mad!</p>

<p>He points the deathbone and the quick are still. <em>Insomnia, <br />
somnia somniorum. Awmawm.</em></p>

<p>MERCIUS (of hisself): <em>Domine vopiscus!</em> My fault, his fault, <br />
a kingship through a fault! Pariah, cannibal Cain, I who oathily <br />
forswore the womb that bore you and the paps I sometimes <br />
sucked, you who ever since have been one black mass of jigs and <br />
jimjams, haunted by a convulsionary sense of not having been <br />
or being all that I might have been or you meant to becoming,<span></span></p>
