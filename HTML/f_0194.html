<p class="ni">bewailing like a man that innocence which I could not defend <br />
like a woman, lo, you there, Cathmon-Carbery, and thank Movies <br />
from the innermost depths of my still attrite heart, Wherein <br />
the days of youyouth are evermixed mimine, now ere the comp- <br />
line hour of being alone athands itself and a puff or so before <br />
we yield our spiritus to the wind, for (though that royal one <br />
has not yet drunk a gouttelette from his consummation and the <br />
flowerpot on the pole, the spaniel pack and their quarry, retainers <br />
and the public house proprietor have not budged a millimetre <br />
and all that has been done has yet to be done and done again, <br />
when’s day’s woe, and lo, you’re doomed, joyday dawns and, <br />
la, you dominate) it is to you, firstborn and firstfruit of woe, to <br />
me, branded sheep, pick of the wasterpaperbaskel, by the <br />
tremours of Thundery and Ulerin’s dogstar, you alone, wind- <br />
blasted tree of the knowledge of beautiful andevil, ay, clothed <br />

deltilla, running with her tidings, old the news of the great big <br />
world, sonnies had a scrap, woewoewoe! bab’s baby walks at <br />
seven months, waywayway! bride leaves her raid at Punchestime, <br />
stud stoned before a racecourseful, two belles that make the <br />
one appeal, dry yanks will visit old sod, and fourtiered skirts <br />
are up, mesdames, while Parimiknie wears popular short legs, <br />
and twelve hows to mix a tipsy wake, did ye hear, colt Cooney? <br />
did ye ever, filly Fortescue? with a beck, with a spring, all her <br />
rillringlets shaking, rocks drops in her tachie, tramtokens in <br />
her hair, all waived to a point and then all inuendation, little <br />
oldfashioned mummy, little wonderful mummy, ducking under <br />
bridges, bellhopping the weirs, dodging by a bit of bog, rapid- <br />
shooting round the bends, by Tallaght’s green hills and the <br />
pools of the phooka and a place they call it Blessington and<span></span></p>
