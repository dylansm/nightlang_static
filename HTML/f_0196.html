tell me all about <br />
Anna Livia! I want to hear all</p>

<p class="ni">about Anna Livia. Well, you know Anna Livia? Yes, of course, <br />
we all know Anna Livia. Tell me all. Tell me now. You’ll die <br />
when you hear. Well, you know, when the old cheb went futt <br />
and did what you know. Yes, I know, go on. Wash quit and <br />
don’t be dabbling. Tuck up your sleeves and loosen your talk- <br />
tapes. And don’t butt me<span class="em">—</span>hike!<span class="em">—</span>when you bend. Or what- <br />
ever it was they threed to make out he thried to two in the <br />
Fiendish park. He’s an awful old reppe. Look at the shirt of him! <br />
Look at the dirt of it! He has all my water black on me. And it <br />
steeping and stuping since this time last wik. How many goes <br />
is it I wonder I washed it? I know by heart the places he likes to <br />
saale, duddurty devil! Scorching my hand and starving my fa- <br />
mine to make his private linen public. Wallop it well with your <br />
battle and clean it. My wrists are wrusty rubbing the mouldaw <br />
stains. And the dneepers of wet and the gangres of sin in it! What <br />
was it he did a tail at all on Animal Sendai? And how long was <br />
he under loch and neagh? It was put in the newses what he did, <br />
nicies and priers, the King fierceas Humphrey, with illysus dis- <br />
tilling, exploits and all. But toms will till. I know he well. Temp <br />
untamed will hist for no man. As you spring so shall you neap. <br />
O, the roughty old rappe! Minxing marrage and making loof.</p>
