tell me all about  
Anna Livia! I want to hear all

%ni%about Anna Livia. Well, you know Anna Livia? Yes, of course,  
we all know Anna Livia. Tell me all. Tell me now. You’ll die  
when you hear. Well, you know, when the old cheb went futt  
and did what you know. Yes, I know, go on. Wash quit and  
don’t be dabbling. Tuck up your sleeves and loosen your talk-  
tapes. And don’t butt me%—%hike!%—%when you bend. Or what-  
ever it was they threed to make out he thried to two in the  
Fiendish park. He’s an awful old reppe. Look at the shirt of him!  
Look at the dirt of it! He has all my water black on me. And it  
steeping and stuping since this time last wik. How many goes  
is it I wonder I washed it? I know by heart the places he likes to  
saale, duddurty devil! Scorching my hand and starving my fa-  
mine to make his private linen public. Wallop it well with your  
battle and clean it. My wrists are wrusty rubbing the mouldaw  
stains. And the dneepers of wet and the gangres of sin in it! What  
was it he did a tail at all on Animal Sendai? And how long was  
he under loch and neagh? It was put in the newses what he did,  
nicies and priers, the King fierceas Humphrey, with illysus dis-  
tilling, exploits and all. But toms will till. I know he well. Temp  
untamed will hist for no man. As you spring so shall you neap.  
O, the roughty old rappe! Minxing marrage and making loof.
