<p>Reeve Gootch was right and Reeve Drughad was sinistrous! And <br />
the cut of him! And the strut of him! How he used to hold his <br />
head as high as a howeth, the famous eld duke alien, with a hump <br />
of grandeur on him like a walking wiesel rat. And his derry’s <br />
own drawl and his corksown blather and his doubling stutter <br />
and his gullaway swank. Ask Lictor Hackett or Lector Reade <br />
of Garda Growley or the Boy with the Billyclub. How elster is <br />
he a called at all? Qu’appelle? Huges Caput Earlyfouler. Or <br />
where was he born or how was he found? Urgothland, Tvistown <br />
on the Kattekat? New Hunshire, Concord on the Merrimake? <br />
Who blocksmitt her saft anvil or yelled lep to her pail? Was her <br />
banns never loosened in Adam and Eve’s or were him and her <br />
but captain spliced? For mine ether duck I thee drake. And by <br />
my wildgaze I thee gander. Flowey and Mount on the brink of <br />
time makes wishes and fears for a happy isthmass. She can show <br />
all her lines, with love, license to play. And if they don’t remarry <br />
that hook and eye may! O, passmore that and oxus another! Don <br />
Dom Dombdomb and his wee follyo! Was his help inshored in <br />
the Stork and Pelican against bungelars, flu and third risk par- <br />
ties? I heard he dug good tin with his doll, delvan first and duvlin <br />
after, when he raped her home, Sabrine asthore, in a parakeet’s <br />
cage, by dredgerous lands and devious delts, playing catched and <br />
mythed with the gleam of her shadda, (if a flic had been there to <br />
pop up and pepper him!) past auld min’s manse and Maisons <br />
Allfou and the rest of incurables and the last of immurables, the <br />
quaggy waag for stumbling. Who sold you that jackalantern’s <br />
tale? Pemmican’s pasty pie! Not a grasshoop to ring her, not an <br />
antsgrain of ore. In a gabbard he barqued it, the boat of life, <br />
from the harbourless Ivernikan Okean, till he spied the loom of <br />
his landfall and he loosed two croakers from under his tilt, the <br />
gran Phenician rover. By the smell of her kelp they made the <br />
pigeonhouse. Like fun they did! But where was Himself, the <br />
timoneer? That marchantman he suivied their scutties right over <br />
the wash, his cameleer’s burnous breezing up on him, till with <br />
his runagate bowmpriss he roade and borst her bar. Pilcomayo! <br />
Suchcaughtawan! And the whale’s away with the grayling! Tune<span></span></p>
