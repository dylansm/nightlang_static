<p class="ni">while the prom beauties sreeked nith their bearers’ skins!<span class="em">—</span>in <br />
a period gown of changeable jade that would robe the wood of <br />
two cardinals’ chairs and crush poor Cullen and smother Mac- <br />
Cabe. O blazerskate! Theirs porpor patches! And brahming to <br />
him down the feedchute, with her femtyfyx kinds of fondling <br />
endings, the poother rambling off her nose: <em>Vuggybarney, <br />
Wickerymandy! Hello, ducky, please don’t die!</em> Do you know <br />
what she started cheeping after, with a choicey voicey like water- <br />
glucks or Madame Delba to Romeoreszk? You’ll never guess. <br />
Tell me. Tell me. <em>Phoebe, dearest, tell, O tell me and I loved you <br />
better nor you knew.</em> And letting on hoon var daft about the warbly <br />
sangs from over holmen: <em>High hellskirt saw ladies hensmoker lily- <br />
hung pigger:</em> and soay and soan and so firth and so forth in a tone <br />
sonora and Oom Bothar below like Bheri-Bheri in his sandy <br />
cloak, so umvolosy, as deaf as a yawn, the stult! Go away! Poor <br />
deef old deary! Yare only teasing! Anna Liv? As chalk is my <br />
judge! And didn’t she up in sorgues and go and trot doon and <br />
stand in her douro, puffing her old dudheen, and every shirvant <br />
siligirl or wensum farmerette walking the pilend roads, Sawy, <br />
Fundally, Daery or Maery, Milucre, Awny or Graw, usedn’t she <br />
make her a simp or sign to slip inside by the sullyport? You don’t <br />
say, the sillypost? Bedouix but I do! Calling them in, one by one <br />
(To Blockbeddum here! Here the Shoebenacaddie!) and legging <br />
a jig or so on the sihl to show them how to shake their benders <br />
and the dainty how to bring to mind the gladdest garments out <br />
of sight and all the way of a maid with a man and making a sort <br />
of a cackling noise like two and a penny or half a crown and hold- <br />
ing up a silliver shiner. Lordy, lordy, did she so? Well, of all the <br />
ones ever I heard! Throwing all the neiss little whores in the <br />
world at him! To inny captured wench you wish of no matter <br />
what sex of pleissful ways two adda tammar a lizzy a lossie to <br />
hug and hab haven in Humpy’s apron!</p>

<p>And what was the wyerye rima she made! Odet! Odet! Tell <br />
me the trent of it while I’m lathering hail out of Denis Florence <br />
MacCarthy’s combies. Rise it, flut ye, pian piena! I’m dying <br />
down off my iodine feet until I lerryn Anna Livia’s cushingloo,<span></span></p>
