<p class="ni">that was writ by one and rede by two and trouved by a poule in <br />
the parco! I can see that, I see you are. How does it tummel? <br />
Listen now. Are you listening? Yes, yes! Idneed I am! Tarn your <br />
ore ouse! Essonne inne!</p>

<p><em>By earth end the cloudy but I badly went e brandnew bankside, <br />
bedamp and I do, and a plumper at that!</em></p>

<p><em>For the putty affair I have is wore out, so it is, sitting, yaping and <br />
waiting for my old Dane hodder dodderer, my life in death companion, <br />
my frugal key of our larder, my much-altered camel’s hump, my <br />
jointspoiler, my maymoon’s honey, my fool to the last Decemberer, <br />
to wake himself out of his winter’s doze and bore me down like he <br />
used to.</em></p>

<p><em>Is there irwell a lord of the manor or a knight of the shire at strike, <br />
I wonder, that’d dip me a dace or two in cash for washing and <br />
darning his worshipful socks for him now we’re run out of horse- <br />
brose and milk?</em></p>

<p><em>Only for my short Brittas bed made’s as snug as it smells it’s <br />
out I’d lep and off with me to the slobs deua Tolka or the plage au <br />
Clontarf to feale the gay aire of my salt troublin bay and the race <br />
of the saywint up me ambushure.</em></p>

<p>Onon! Onon! tell me more. Tell me every tiny teign. I want <br />
to know every single ingul. Down to what made the potters fly <br />
into jagsthole. And why were the vesles vet. That homa fever’s <br />
winning me wome. If a mahun of the horse but hard me! We’d <br />
be bundukiboi meet askarigal. Well, now comes the hazel- <br />
hatchery part. After Clondalkin the Kings’s Inns. We’ll soon be <br />
there with the freshet. How many aleveens had she in tool? I can’t <br />
rightly rede you that. Close only knows. Some say she had three <br />
figures to fill and confined herself to a hundred eleven, wan by- <br />
wan bywan, making meanacuminamoyas. Olaph lamm et, all that <br />
pack? We won’t have room in the kirkeyaard. She can’t remember <br />
half of the cradlenames she smacked on them by the grace of her <br />
boxing bishop’s infallible slipper, the cane for Kund and abbles for <br />
Eyolf and ayther nayther for Yakov Yea. A hundred and how? <br />
They did well to rechristien her Pluhurabelle. O loreley! What a <br />
loddon lodes! Heigh ho! But it’s quite on the cards she’ll shed<span></span></p>
