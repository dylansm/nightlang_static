Heehaw! She must have been a gadabount in her day, so she <br />
must, more than most. Shoal she was, gidgad. She had a flewmen <br />
of her owen. Then a toss nare scared that lass, so aimai moe, <br />
that’s agapo! Tell me, tell me, how cam she camlin through all <br />
her fellows, the neckar she was, the diveline? Casting her perils <br />
before our swains from Fonte-in-Monte to Tidingtown and <br />
from Tidingtown tilhavet. Linking one and knocking the next, <br />
tapting a flank and tipting a jutty and palling in and pietaring <br />
out and clyding by on her eastway. Waiwhou was the first thur- <br />
ever burst? Someone he was, whuebra they were, in a tactic attack <br />
or in single combat. Tinker, tilar, souldrer, salor, Pieman Peace <br />
or Polistaman. That’s the thing I’m elwys on edge to esk. Push <br />
up and push vardar and come to uphill headquarters! Was it <br />
waterlows year, after Grattan or Flood, or when maids were in <br />
Arc or when three stood hosting? Fidaris will find where the <br />

her graveller was, a dynast of Leinster, a wolf of the sea, or what <br />
he did or how blyth she played or how, when, why, where and <br />
who offon he jumpnad her and how it was gave her away. She <br />
was just a young thin pale soft shy slim slip of a thing then, <br />
sauntering, by silvamoonlake and he was a heavy trudging <br />
lurching lieabroad of a Curraghman, making his hay for whose <br />
sun to shine on, as tough as the oaktrees (peats be with them!) <br />
used to rustle that time down by the dykes of killing Kildare, <br />
for forstfellfoss with a plash across her. She thought she’s sankh <br />
neathe the ground with nymphant shame when he gave her the <br />
tigris eye! O happy fault! Me wish it was he! You’re wrong there, <br />
