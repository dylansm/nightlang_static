<p class="ni">Wickenlow, garden of Erin, before she ever dreamt she’d lave <br />
Kilbride and go foaming under Horsepass bridge, with the great <br />
southerwestern windstorming her traces and the midland’s grain- <br />
waster asarch for her track, to wend her ways byandby, robecca <br />
or worse, to spin and to grind, to swab and to thrash, for all her <br />
golden lifey in the barleyfields and pennylotts of Humphrey’s <br />
fordofhurdlestown and lie with a landleaper, wellingtonorseher. <br />
Alesse, the lagos of girly days! For the dove of the dunas! Was- <br />
ut? Izod? Are you sarthin suir? Not where the Finn fits into the <br />
Mourne, not where the Nore takes lieve of Blœm, not where the <br />
Braye divarts the Farer, not where the Moy changez her minds <br />
twixt Cullin and Conn tween Cunn and Collin? Or where Neptune <br />
sculled and Tritonville rowed and leandros three bumped heroines <br />

feeling, he plunged both of his newly anointed hands, the core of <br />
his cushlas, in her singimari saffron strumans of hair, parting them <br />
and soothing her and mingling it, that was deepdark and ample <br />
like this red bog at sundown. By that Vale Vowclose’s lucydlac, <br />
the reignbeau’s heavenarches arronged orranged her. Afroth- <br />
dizzying galbs, her enamelled eyes indergoading him on to the <br />
vierge violetian. Wish a wish! Why a why? Mavro! Letty Lerck’s <br />

And Simba the Slayer of his Oga is slewd. He cuddle not help <br />
himself, thurso that hot on him, he had to forget the monk in <br />
