<p class="ni">the freckled forehead. While you’d parse secheressa she hielt her <br />
souff’. But she ruz two feet hire in her aisne aestumation. And <br />
steppes on stilts ever since. That was kissuahealing with bantur <br />
for balm! O, wasn’t he the bold priest? And wasn’t she the <br />
naughty Livvy? Nautic Naama’s now her navn. Two lads in <br />
scoutsch breeches went through her before that, Barefoot Burn <br />
and Wallowme Wade, Lugnaquillia’s noblesse pickts, before she <br />
had a hint of a hair at her fanny to hide or a bossom to tempt a <br />
birch canoedler not to mention a bulgic porterhouse barge. And <br />
ere that again, leada, laida, all unraidy, too faint to buoy the <br />
fairiest rider, too frail to flirt with a cygnet’s plume, she was licked <br />
by a hound, Chirripa-Chirruta, while poing her pee, pure and <br />
simple, on the spur of the hill in old Kippure, in birdsong and <br />
shearingtime, but first of all, worst of all, the wiggly livvly, she <br />
sideslipped out by a gap in the Devil’s glen while Sally her nurse <br />
was sound asleep in a sloot and, feefee fiefie, fell over a spillway <br />
before she found her stride and lay and wriggled in all the stag- <br />
nant black pools of rainy under a fallow coo and she laughed <br />
innocefree with her limbs aloft and a whole drove of maiden <br />
hawthorns blushing and looking askance upon her.</p>

<p>Drop me the sound of the findhorn’s name, Mtu or Mti, som- <br />
bogger was wisness. And drip me why in the flenders was she <br />
frickled. And trickle me through was she marcellewaved or was <br />
it weirdly a wig she wore. And whitside did they droop their <br />
glows in their florry, aback to wist or affront to sea? In fear to <br />
hear the dear so near or longing loth and loathing longing? Are <br />
you in the swim or are you out? O go in, go on, go an! I mean <br />
about what you know. I know right well what you mean. Rother! <br />
You’d like the coifs and guimpes, snouty, and me to do the <br />
greasy jub on old Veronica’s wipers. What am I rancing now <br />
and I’ll thank you? Is it a pinny or is it a surplice? Arran, where’s <br />
your nose? And where’s the starch? That’s not the vesdre bene- <br />
diction smell. I can tell from here by their <em>eau de Colo</em> and the <br />
scent of her oder they’re Mrs Magrath’s. And you ought to have <br />
aird them. They’ve moist come off her. Creases in silk they <br />
are, not crampton lawn. Baptiste me, father, for she has sinned!<span></span></p>
