keeps fine who’ll come tripping to sightsee? How’ll? Ask me <br />
next what I haven’t got! The Belvedarean exhibitioners. In their <br />
cruisery caps and oarsclub colours. What hoo, they band! And <br />
what hoa, they buck! And here is her nubilee letters too. Ellis <br />
on quay in scarlet thread. Linked for the world on a flush- <br />

Mammon, Kinsella’s Lilith! Now who has been tearing the leg <br />
of her drawars on her? Which leg is it? The one with the bells <br />
on it. Rinse them out and aston along with you! Where did I <br />
stop? Never stop! Continuarration! You’re not there yet. I <br />

Phoenix Tavern or Power’s Inn or Jude’s Hotel or wherever you <br />
scoured the countryside from Nannywater to Vartryville or from <br />
Porta Lateen to the lootin quarter you found his ikom etsched <br />
