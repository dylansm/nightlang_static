<p class="ni">elb. Quick, look at her cute and saise her quirk for the bicker she <br />
lives the slicker she grows. Save us and tagus! No more? Werra <br />
where in ourthe did you ever pick a Lambay chop as big as a <br />
battering ram? Ay, you’re right. I’m epte to forgetting, Like <br />
Liviam Liddle did Loveme Long. The linth of my hough, I say! <br />
She wore a ploughboy’s nailstudded clogs, a pair of ploughfields <br />
in themselves: a sugarloaf hat with a gaudyquiviry peak and a <br />
band of gorse for an arnoment and a hundred streamers dancing <br />
off it and a guildered pin to pierce it: owlglassy bicycles boggled <br />
her eyes: and a fishnetzeveil for the sun not to spoil the wrinklings <br />
of her hydeaspects: potatorings boucled the loose laubes of her <br />
laudsnarers: her nude cuba stockings were salmospotspeckled: she <br />
sported a galligo shimmy of hazevaipar tinto that never was fast <br />
till it ran in the washing: stout stays, the rivals, lined her length: <br />
her bloodorange bockknickers, a two in one garment, showed <br />
natural nigger boggers, fancyfastened, free to undo: her black- <br />
stripe tan joseph was sequansewn and teddybearlined, with wavy <br />
rushgreen epaulettes and a leadown here and there of royal <br />
swansruff: a brace of gaspers stuck in her hayrope garters: her <br />
civvy codroy coat with alpheubett buttons was boundaried round <br />
with a twobar tunnel belt: a fourpenny bit in each pocketside <br />
weighed her safe from the blowaway windrush; she had a clothes- <br />
peg tight astride on her joki’s nose and she kep on grinding a <br />
sommething quaint in her fiumy mouth and the rrreke of the <br />
fluve of the tail of the gawan of her snuffdrab siouler’s skirt <br />
trailed ffiffty odd Irish miles behind her lungarhodes.</p>

<p>Hellsbells, I’m sorry I missed her! Sweet gumptyum and no- <br />
body fainted! But in whelk of her mouths? Was her naze alight? <br />
Everyone that saw her said the dowce little delia looked a bit <br />
queer. Lotsy trotsy, mind the poddle! Missus, be good and don’t <br />
fol in the say! Fenny poor hex she must have charred. Kickhams <br />
a frumpier ever you saw! Making mush mullet’s eyes at her boys <br />
dobelon. And they crowned her their chariton queen, all the <br />
maids. Of the may? You don’t say! Well for her she couldn’t <br />
see herself. I recknitz wharfore the darling murrayed her mirror. <br />
She did? Mersey me! There was a koros of drouthdropping sur-<span></span></p>
