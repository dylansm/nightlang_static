feeding, in contemplation of the fluctuation and the undification <br />
of her filimentation, lolling and leasing on North Lazers’ Waal <br />
all eelfare week by the Jukar Yoick’s and as soon as they saw her <br />
meander by that marritime way in her grasswinter’s weeds and <br />
twigged who was under her archdeaconess bonnet, Avondale’s <br />

Crutches to Master Bates: <em>Between our two southsates and the <br />
granite they’re warming, or her face has been lifted or Alp has doped!</em></p>

<p>But what was the game in her mixed baggyrhatty? Just the <br />
tembo in her tumbo or pilipili from her pepperpot? Saas and <br />
taas and specis bizaas. And where in thunder did she plunder? <br />
Fore the battle or efter the ball? I want to get it frisk from the <br />

spittle, with a Christmas box apiece for aisch and iveryone of her <br />
childer, the birthday gifts they dreamt they gabe her, the spoiled <br />
she fleetly laid at our door! On the matt, by the pourch and in- <br />
under the cellar. The rivulets ran aflod to see, the glashaboys, the <br />
pollynooties. Out of the paunschaup on to the pyre. And they all <br />
about her, juvenile leads and ingenuinas, from the slime of their <br />
slums and artesaned wellings, rickets and riots, like the Smyly <br />
