<p class="ni"><em>Dichter</em> and Lefanu (Sheridan’s) old <em>House by the Coachyard</em> and <br />
Mill (J.) <em>On Woman with Ditto on the Floss</em>. Ja, a swamp for Alt- <br />
muehler and a stone for his flossies! I know how racy they move <br />
his wheel. My hands are blawcauld between isker and suda like <br />
that piece of pattern chayney there, lying below. Or where is it? <br />
Lying beside the sedge I saw it. Hoangho, my sorrow, I’ve lost <br />
it! Aimihi! With that turbary water who could see? So near and <br />
yet so far! But O, gihon! I lovat a gabber. I could listen to maure <br />
and moravar again. Regn onder river. Flies do your float. Thick <br />
is the life for mere.</p>

<p>Well, you know or don’t you kennet or haven’t I told you <br />
every telling has a taling and that’s the he and the she of it. Look, <br />
look, the dusk is growing! My branches lofty are taking root. <br />
And my cold cher’s gone ashley. Fieluhr? Filou! What age is at? <br />
It saon is late. ’Tis endless now senne eye or erewone last saw <br />
Waterhouse’s clogh. They took it asunder, I hurd thum sigh. <br />
When will they reassemble it? O, my back, my back, my bach! <br />

for Sexaloitez! And Concepta de Send-us-pray! Pang! Wring out <br />
the clothes! Wring in the dew! Godavari, vert the showers! And <br />
grant thaya grace! Aman. Will we spread them here now? Ay, <br />
we will. Flip! Spread on your bank and I’ll spread mine on mine. <br />
Flep! It’s what I’m doing. Spread! It’s churning chill. Der went is <br />
rising. I’ll lay a few stones on the hostel sheets. A man and his bride <br />
embraced between them. Else I’d have sprinkled and folded them <br />
only. And I’ll tie my butcher’s apron here. It’s suety yet. The <br />
strollers will pass it by. Six shifts, ten kerchiefs, nine to hold to <br />
the fire and this for the code, the convent napkins, twelve, one <br />
baby’s shawl. Good mother Jossiph knows, she said. Whose <br />
head? Mutter snores? Deataceas! Wharnow are alle her childer, <br />
say? In kingdome gone or power to come or gloria be to them <br />
farther? Allalivial, allalluvial! Some here, more no more, more <br />
again lost alla stranger. I’ve heard tell that same brooch of the <br />
Shannons was married into a family in Spain. And all the Dun- <br />
