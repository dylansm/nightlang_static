<p class="ni">them. Is that the Poolbeg flasher beyant, pharphar, or a fireboat <br />
coasting nyar the Kishtna or a glow I behold within a hedge or <br />
my Garry come back from the Indes? Wait till the honeying of <br />
the lune, love! Die eve, little eve, die! We see that wonder in <br />
your eye. We’ll meet again, we’ll part once more. The spot I’ll <br />
seek if the hour you’ll find. My chart shines high where the blue <br />
milk’s upset. Forgivemequick, I’m going! Bubye! And you, <br />
pluck your watch, forgetmenot. Your evenlode. So save to <br />
jurna’s end! My sights are swimming thicker on me by the sha- <br />
dows to this place. I sow home slowly now by own way, moy- <br />
valley way. Towy I too, rathmine.</p>

<p>Ah, but she was the queer old skeowsha anyhow, Anna Livia, <br />
trinkettoes! And sure he was the quare old buntz too, Dear Dirty <br />
Dumpling, foostherfather of fingalls and dotthergills. Gammer <br />
and gaffer we’re all their gangsters. Hadn’t he seven dams to wive <br />
him? And every dam had her seven crutches. And every crutch <br />
had its seven hues. And each hue had a differing cry. Sudds for <br />
me and supper for you and the doctor’s bill for Joe John. Befor! <br />
Bifur! He married his markets, cheap by foul, I know, like any <br />
Etrurian Catholic Heathen, in their pinky limony creamy birnies <br />
and their turkiss indienne mauves. But at milkidmass who was <br />
the spouse? Then all that was was fair. Tys Elvenland! Teems of <br />
times and happy returns. The seim anew. Ordovico or viricordo. <br />
Anna was, Livia is, Plurabelle’s to be. Northmen’s thing made <br />
southfolk’s place but howmulty plurators made eachone in per- <br />
son? Latin me that, my trinity scholard, out of eure sanscreed into <br />
oure eryan! <em>Hircus Civis Eblanensis!</em> He had buckgoat paps on <br />
him, soft ones for orphans. Ho, Lord! Twins of his bosom. Lord <br />
save us! And ho! Hey? What all men. Hot? His tittering daugh- <br />
ters of. Whawk?</p>

<p>Can’t hear with the waters of. The chittering waters of. Flitter- <br />
ing bats, fieldmice bawk talk. Ho! Are you not gone ahome? <br />
What Thom Malone? Can’t hear with bawk of bats, all thim liffey- <br />
ing waters of. Ho, talk save us! My foos won’t moos. I feel as old <br />
as yonder elm. A tale told of Shaun or Shem? All Livia’s daughter- <br />
sons. Dark hawks hear us. Night! Night! My ho head halls. I feel<span></span></p>
