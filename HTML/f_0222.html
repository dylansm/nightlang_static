<p class="ni">ment in the pit. Accidental music providentially arranged by <br />
L’Archet and Laccorde. Melodiotiosities in purefusion by the <br />
score. To start with in the beginning, we need hirtly bemark, <br />
a community prayer, everyone for himself, and to conclude <br />
with as an exodus, we think it well to add, a chorale in canon, <br />
good for us all for us all us all all. Songs betune the acts by <br />
the ambiamphions of Annapolis, Joan MockComic, male so- <br />
prano, and Jean Souslevin, bass noble, respectively: O, Mester <br />
Sogermon, ef thes es whot ye deux, then I’m not surpleased ye <br />
want that bottle of Sauvequipeu and Oh Off Nunch Der Rasche <br />
Ver Lasse Mitsch Nitscht. Till the summit scenes of climbacks <br />
castastrophear, <em>The Bearded Mountain</em> (Polymop Barethe- <br />
rootsch), and <em>The River Romps to Nursery</em> (Maidykins in Undi- <br />
form). The whole thugogmagog, including the portions under- <br />
stood to be oddmitted as the results of the respective titulars <br />
neglecting to produce themselves, to be wound up for an after- <br />
enactment by a Magnificent Transformation Scene showing the <br />
Radium Wedding of Neid and Moorning and the Dawn of <br />
Peace, Pure, Perfect and Perpetual, Waking the Weary of the <br />
World.</p>

<p>Chuffy was a nangel then and his soard fleshed light like like- <br />

prowlabouts. Make a shine on the curst. Emen.</p>

<p>But the duvlin sulph was in Glugger, that lost-to-lurning. <br />
Punct. He was sbuffing and sputing, tussing like anisine, whip- <br />
ping his eyesoult and gnatsching his teats over the brividies from <br />
existers and the outher liubbocks of life. He halth kelchy chosen <br />
a clayblade and makes prayses to his three of clubs. To part from <br />
these, my corsets, is into overlusting fear. Acts of feet, hoof and <br />
jarrety: athletes longfoot. Djowl, uphere!</p>

<p>Aminxt that nombre of evelings, but how pierceful in their so- <br />
jestiveness were those first girly stirs, with zitterings of flight re- <br />
leased and twinglings of twitchbells in rondel after, with waver- <br />
ings that made shimmershake rather naightily all the duskcended <br />
airs and shylit beaconings from shehind hims back. Sammy, call<span></span></p>
