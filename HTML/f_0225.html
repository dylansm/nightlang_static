<p class="ni">is a little tittertit of hilarity (Lad-o’-me-soul! Lad-o’-me-soul, <br />
see!) and the wordchary is atvoiced ringsoundinly by their toots <br />
ensembled, though not meaning to be clever, but just with a shrug <br />
of their hips to go to troy and harff a freak at himself by all that <br />
story to the ulstramarines. Otherwised, holding their noises, <br />
they insinuate quiet private, Ni, he make peace in his preaches <br />
and play with esteem.</p>

<p>Warewolff! Olff! Toboo!</p>

<p>So olff for his topheetuck the ruck made raid, aslick aslegs <br />
would run; and he ankered on his hunkers with the belly belly <br />
prest. Asking: What’s my muffinstuffinaches for these times? To <br />
weat: Breath and bother and whatarcurss. Then breath more <br />
bother and more whatarcurss. Then no breath no bother but wor- <br />
rawarrawurms. And Shim shallave shome.</p>

<p>As Rigagnolina to Mountagnone, what she meaned he could <br />
not can. All she meaned was golten sylvup, all she meaned was <br />
some Knight’s ploung jamn. It’s driving her dafft like he’s so <br />

<span class="em">—</span>No.
<span class="em">—</span>or Hellfeuersteyn?
<span class="em">—</span>No.
<span class="em">—</span>Or Van Diemen’s coral pearl?
<span class="em">—</span>No.</p>

<p>He has lost.</p>

<p>Off to clutch, Glugg! Forwhat! Shape your reres, Glugg! <br />
Foreweal! Ring we round, Chuff! Fairwell! Chuffchuff’s inners <br />
even. All’s rice with their whorl!</p>

<p>Yet, ah tears, who can her mater be? She’s promised he’d eye <br />
her. To try up her pretti. But now it’s so longed and so fared and <br />
so forth. Jerry for jauntings. Alabye! Fled.</p>

<p>The flossies all and mossies all they drooped upon her draped <br />
brimfall. The bowknots, the showlots, they wilted into woeblots.<span></span></p>
