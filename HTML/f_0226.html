<p class="ni">The pearlagraph, the pearlagraph, knew whitchly whether to weep <br />
or laugh. For always down in Carolinas lovely Dinahs vaunt their <br />
view.</p>

<p>Poor Isa sits a glooming so gleaming in the gloaming; the tin- <br />
celles a touch tarnished wind no lovelinoise awound her swan’s. <br />
Hey, lass! Woefear gleam she so glooming, this pooripathete I <br />
solde? Her beauman’s gone of a cool. Be good enough to symper- <br />
ise. If he’s at anywhere she’s therefor to join him. If it’s to no- <br />
where she’s going to too. Buf if he’ll go to be a son to France’s <br />
she’ll stay daughter of Clare. Bring tansy, throw myrtle, strew <br />
rue, rue, rue. She is fading out like Journee’s clothes so you can’t <br />
see her now. Still we know how Day the Dyer works, in dims <br />
and deeps and dusks and darks. And among the shades that Eve’s <br />
now wearing she’ll meet anew fiancy, tryst and trow. Mammy <br />
was, Mimmy is, Minuscoline’s to be. In the Dee dips a dame and <br />
the dame desires a demselle but the demselle dresses dolly and <br />
the dolly does a dulcydamble. The same renew. For though <br />
she’s unmerried she’ll after truss up and help that hussyband how <br />
to hop. Hip it and trip it and chirrub and sing. Lord Chuffy’s sky <br />
sheraph and Glugg’s got to swing.</p>

<p>So and so, toe by toe, to and fro they go round, for they are the <br />
ingelles, scattering nods as girls who may, for they are an angel’s <br />
garland.</p>

<p>Catchmire stockings, libertyed garters, shoddyshoes, quicked <br />
out with selver. Pennyfair caps on pinnyfore frocks and a ring on <br />
her fomefing finger. And they leap so looply, looply, as they link <br />
to light. And they look so loovely, loovelit, noosed in a nuptious <br />
night. Withasly glints in. Andecoy glants out. They ramp it a <br />
little, a lessle, a lissle. Then rompride round in rout.</p>

<p>Say them all but tell them apart, cadenzando coloratura! R is <br />
Rubretta and A is Arancia, Y is for Yilla and N for greeneriN. B <br />
is Boyblue with odalisque O while W waters the fleurettes of no- <br />
vembrance. Though they’re all but merely a schoolgirl yet these <br />
way went they. I’ th’ view o’ th’avignue dancing goes entrancing <br />
roundly. Miss Oodles of Anems before the Luvium doeslike. So. <br />
And then again doeslike. So. And miss Endles of Eons efter Dies<span></span></p>
