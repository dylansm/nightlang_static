wiles of Winsure.</p>

<p>The grocer’s bawd she slips her hand in the haricot bag, the <br />
lady in waiting sips her sup from the paraffin can, Mrs Wildhare <br />
Quickdoctor helts her skelts up the casuaway the flasht instinct <br />
she herds if a tinkle of tunder, the widow Megrievy she knits cats’ <br />
cradles, this bountiful actress leashes a harrier under her tongue, <br />
and here’s the girl who she’s kneeled in coldfashion and she’s told <br />
her priest (spt!) she’s pot on a chap (chp!) and this lass not least, <br />
this rickissime woman, who she writes foot fortunes money times <br />
over in the nursery dust with her capital thumb. Buzz. All run- <br />
away sheep bound back bopeep, trailing their teenes behind <br />
them. And these ways wend they. And those ways went they. <br />
Winnie, Olive and Beatrice, Nelly and Ida, Amy and Rue. Here <br />
they come back, all the gay pack, for they are the florals, from <br />
foncey and pansey to papavere’s blush, foresake-me-nought, <br />

he don’t know whose hue. If goosseys gazious would but fain <br />
smile him a smile he would be fondling a praise he ate some nice <br />
bit of fluff. But no geste reveals the unconnouth. They’re all <br />
odds against him, the beasties. Scratch. Start.</p>

<p>He dove his head into Wat Murrey, gave Stewart Ryall a puck <br />
on the plexus, wrestled a hurry-come-union with the Gillie Beg, <br />
wiped all his sinses, martial and menial, out of Shrove Sundy <br />
MacFearsome, excremuncted as freely as any frothblower into <br />
MacIsaac, had a belting bout, chaste to chaste, with McAdoo <br />
about nothing and, childhood’s age being aye the shameleast, tel <br />
