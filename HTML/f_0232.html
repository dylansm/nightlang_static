not give him chromitis! For the mauwe that blinks you blank is <br />
mostly Carbo. Where the inflammabilis might pursuive his com- <br />
burenda with a pure flame and a true flame and a flame all too- <br />
gasser, soot. The worst is over. Wait! And the dubuny Mag may <br />
gang to preesses. With Dinny Finneen, me canty, ho! In the lost <br />
of the gleamens. Sousymoust. For he would himself deal a treat- <br />
ment as might be trusted in anticipation of his inculmination unto <br />
fructification for the major operation. When (pip!) a message <br />
interfering intermitting interskips from them (pet!) on herzian <br />
waves, (call her venicey names! call her a stell!) a butterfly from <br />
her zipclasped handbag, a wounded dove astarted from, escaping <br />
out her forecotes. Isle wail for yews, O doherlynt! The poetesser. <br />
And around its scorched cap she has twilled a twine of flame to <br />
let the laitiest know she’s marrid. And pim it goes backballed. Tot <br />

<p>Now a run for his money! Now a dash to her dot! Old cocker, <br />
young crowy sifadda, sosson. A bran new, speedhount, out- <br />
