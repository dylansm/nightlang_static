cup in their calyzettes, alls they go troping, those parryshoots <br />
from his muscalone pistil, for he can eyespy through them, to <br />
their selfcolours, nevertheleast their tissue peepers, (meaning <br />
Mullabury mesh, the time of appling flowers, a guarded figure <br />
of speech, a variety of perfume, a bridawl, seamist inso one) as <br />
leichtly as see saw (O my goodmiss! O my greatmess! O my <br />

dearest, we herehear, aboutobloss, O coelicola, thee salutamt. <br />
Pattern of our unschoold, pageantmaster, deliverer of softmis- <br />
sives, round the world in forty mails, bag, belt and balmybeam, <br />
our barnaboy, our chepachap, with that pampipe in your put- <br />

seeing and soundhearing and smellsniffing and tastytasting and <br />
tenderumstouchings in all Daneygaul, send us, your adorables, <br />
thou overblaseed, a wise and letters play of all you can ceive, <br />
chief celtech chappy, from your holy post now you hast as- <br />
certained ceremonially our names. Unclean you art not. Outcaste <br />
thou are not. Leperstower, the karman’s loki, has not blanched <br />
at our pollution and your intercourse at ninety legsplits does not <br />
defile. Untouchable is not the scarecrown is on you. You are <br />
pure. You are pure. You are in your puerity. You have not <br />
brought stinking members into the house of Amanti. Elleb Inam, <br />
Titep Notep, we name them to the Hall of Honour. Your head <br />
has been touched by the god Enel-Rah and your face has been <br />
brightened by the goddess Aruc-Ituc. Return, sainted youngling, <br />
and walk once more among us! The rains of Demani are masikal <br />
as of yere. And Baraza is all aflower. Siker of calmy days. As <br />
shiver as shower can be. Our breed and better class is in brood <br />
and bitter pass. Labbeycliath longs. But we’re counting on the <br />
cluck. The Great Cackler comes again. Sweetstaker, Abel lord of <br />
all our haloease, we (to be slightly more femmiliar perhips than is <br />
