<p class="ni">delenes, were drawpairs with two pinmarks, BVD and BVD dot, <br />
so want lotteries of ticklets posthastem (you appreciate?) so as to <br />
be very dainty, if an isaspell, and so as to be verily dandydainty, <br />
if an ishibilley, of and on, to and for, by and with, from you. <br />
Let the hitback hurry his wayward ere the missive has time to <br />
take herself off, ’twill be o’erthemore willfully intomeet if the <br />
coming offence can send our shudders before. We ſeem to have <br />
being elſewhere as tho’ th’ had paſs’d in our ſuſpens. Next <br />
to our shrinking selves we love sensitivas best. For they are <br />
the Angèles. Brick, fauve, jonquil, sprig, fleet, nocturne, smiling <br />
bruise. For they are an Angèle’s garment. We will be constant <br />
(what a word!) and bless the day, for whole hours too, yes, for <br />
sold long syne as we shall be heing in our created being of ours <br />
elvishness, the day you befell, you dreadful temptation! Now <br />
promisus as at our requisted you will remain ignorant of all what <br />
you hear and, though if whilst disrobing to the edge of risk, (the <br />
bisifings in idolhours that satinfines tootoo!) draw a veil till we <br />
next time! You don’t want to peach but bejimboed if ye do! <br />
Perhelps. We ernst too may. How many months or how many <br />
years till the myriadth and first become! Bashfulness be tupped! <br />
May he colp, may he colp her, may he mixandmass colp her! <br />
Talk with a hare and you wake of a tartars. That’s mus. Says the <br />
Law. List! Kicky Lacey, the pervergined, and Bianca Mutantini, <br />
her conversa, drew their fools longth finnishfurst, Herzog van <br />
Vellentam, but me and meother ravin, my coosine of mine, have <br />
mour good three chancers, weothers, after Bohnaparts. The <br />
mything smile of me, my wholesole assumption, shes nowt me- <br />
without as weam twin herewithin, that I love like myselfish, like <br />
smithereens robinsongs, like juneses nutslost, like the blue of the <br />
sky if I stoop for to spy’s between my whiteyoumightcallimbs. <br />
How their duel makes their triel! Eer’s wax for Sur Soord, dong- <br />
dong bollets for the iris riflers, queemswellth of coocome in their <br />
combs for the jennyjos. Caro caressimus! Honey swarns where <br />
mellisponds. Will bee all buzzy one another minnies for the mere <br />
effect that you are so fuld of pollen yourself. Teomeo! Daurdour! <br />
We feel unspeechably thoughtless over it all here in Gizzygazelle<span></span></p>
