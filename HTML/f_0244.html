<p>Hear, O worldwithout! Tiny tattling! Backwoods, be wary! <br />
Daintytrees, go dutch!</p>

<p>But who comes yond with pire on poletop? He who relights <br />
our spearing torch, the moon. Bring lolave branches to mud <br />
cabins and peace to the tents of Ceder, Neomenie! The feast of <br />
Tubbournigglers is at hand. Shopshup. Inisfail! Timple temple <br />

And haste, ’tis time for bairns ta hame. Chickchilds, comeho to <br />
roo. Comehome to roo, wee chickchilds doo, when the wild- <br />
worewolf’s abroad. Ah, let’s away and let’s gay and let’s stay <br />

<p>It darkles, (tinct, tint) all this our funnaminal world. Yon <br />
marshpond by ruodmark verge is visited by the tide. Alvem- <br />
marea! We are circumveiloped by obscuritads. Man and belves <br />
frieren. There is a wish on them to be not doing or anything. Or <br />
just for rugs. Zoo koud! Drr, deff, coal lay on and, pzz, call us <br />

trail of Gill not yet is to be seen, rocksdrops, up benn, down <br />
dell, a craggy road for rambling. Nor yet through starland that <br />
silver sash. What era’s o’ering? Lang gong late. Say long, scielo! <br />
Sillume, see lo! Selene, sail O! Amune! Ark!? Noh?! Nought <br />
stirs in spinney. The swayful pathways of the dragonfly spider <br />
stay still in reedery. Quiet takes back her folded fields. Tranquille <br />

unlatched, the birds, tommelise too, quail silent. ii. Luathan? <br />
