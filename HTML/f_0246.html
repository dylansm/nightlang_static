<p class="ni">de kerkegaard. So who over comes ever for Whoopee Weeks <br />
must put up with the Jug and Chambers.</p>

<p>But heed! Our thirty minutes war’s alull. All’s quiet on the <br />
felled of Gorey. Between the starfort and the thornwood brass <br />
castle flambs with mutton candles. Hushkah, a horn! Gadolmag- <br />
tog! God es El? Housefather calls enthreateningly. From Bran- <br />
denborgenthor. At Asa’s arthre. In thundercloud periwig. With <br />
lightning bug aflash from afinger. My souls and by jings, should <br />
he work his jaw to give down the banks and hark from the tomb! <br />
Ansighosa pokes in her potstill to souse at the sop be sodden <br />
enow and to hear to all the bubbles besaying: the coming man, the <br />
future woman, the food that is to build, what he with fifteen years <br />
will do, the ring in her mouth of joyous guard, stars astir ant <br />
stirabout. A palashe for hirs, a saucy for hers and ladlelike spoons <br />
for the wonner. But ein and twee were never worth three. So they <br />
must have their final since he’s on parole. Et la pau’ Leonie has the <br />
choice of her lives between Josephinus and Mario-Louis for who <br />
is to wear the lily of Bohemey, Florestan, Thaddeus, Hardress or <br />
Myles. And lead raptivity captive. Ready! Like a Finn at a fair. <br />
Now for la belle! Icy-la-Belle!</p>

<p>The campus calls them. Ninan ninan, the gattling gan! Childs <br />
will be wilds. ’Twastold. And vamp, vamp, vamp, the girls are <br />
merchand. The horseshow magnete draws his field and don’t the <br />
fillyings fly? Educande of Sorrento, they newknow knowwell <br />
their Vico’s road. Arranked in their array and flocking for the <br />
fray on that old orangeray, Dolly Brae. For these are not on <br />
terms, they twain, bartrossers, since their baffle of Whatalose <br />
when Adam Leftus and the devil took our hindmost, gegifting <br />
her with his painapple, nor will not be atoned at all in fight to <br />
no finish, that dark deed doer, this wellwilled wooer, Jerkoff and <br />
Eatsoup, Yem or Yan, while felixed is who culpas does and harm’s <br />
worth healing and Brune is bad French for Jour d’Anno. Tiggers <br />
and Tuggers they’re all for tenzones. Bettlimbraves. For she must <br />
walk out. And it must be with who. Teaseforhim. Toesforhim. <br />
Tossforhim. Two. Else there is danger of. Solitude.</p>
