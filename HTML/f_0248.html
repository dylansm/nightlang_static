<p class="ni">quasimodo, royal, sago, tango, umber, vanilla, wisteria, xray, <br />
yesplease, zaza, philomel, theerose. What are they all by? Shee.</p>

<p>If you nude her in her prime, make sure you find her comple- <br />
mentary or, on your very first occasion, by Angus Dagdasson <br />
and all his piccions, she’ll prick you where you’re proudest with <br />
her unsatt speagle eye. Look sharp, she’s signalling from among <br />
the asters. Turn again, wistfultone, lode mere of Doubtlynn! <br />
Arise, Land-under-Wave! Clap your lingua to your pallet, drop <br />
your jowl with a jolt, tambourine until your breath slides, pet a <br />
pout and it’s out. Have you got me, Allysloper?</p>

<p>My top it was brought Achill’s low, my middle I ope before <br />
you, my bottom’s a vulser if ever there valsed and my whole the <br />
flower that stars the day and is solly well worth your pilger’s <br />
fahrt. Where there’s a hitch, a head of things, let henker’s halter <br />
hang the halunkenend. For I see through your weapon. That <br />
cry’s not Cucullus. And his eyelids are painted. If my tutor here <br />
is cut out for an oldeborre I’m Flo, shy of peeps, you know. But <br />
when he beetles backwards, ain’t I fly? Pull the boughpee to see <br />
how we sleep. Bee Peep! Peepette! Would you like that lump of <br />
a tongue for lungeon or this Turkey’s delighter, hys hyphen <br />
mys? My bellyswain’s a twalf whulerusspower though he knows <br />
as much how to man a wife as Dunckle Dalton of matching wools. <br />
Shake hands through the thicketloch! Sweet swanwater! My <br />
other is mouthfilled. This kissing wold’s full of killing fellows <br />
kneeling voyantly to the cope of heaven. And somebody’s com- <br />
ing, I feel for a fect. I’ve a seeklet to sell thee if old Deanns won’t <br />
be threaspanning. When you’ll next have the mind to retire to <br />
be wicked this is as dainty a way as any. Underwoods spells bush- <br />
ment’s business. So if you sprig poplar you’re bound to twig this. <br />
’Twas my lord of Glendalough benedixed the gape for me that <br />
time at Long Entry, commanding the approaches to my intimast <br />
innermost. Look how they’re browthered! Six thirteens at Blanche <br />
de Blanche’s of 3 Behind Street and 2 Turnagain Lane. Awabeg <br />
is my callby, Magnus here’s my Max, Wonder One’s my cipher <br />
and Seven Sisters is my nighbrood. Radouga, Rab will ye na <br />
pick them in their pink of panties. You can colour up till you’re<span></span></p>
