<p class="ni">prawn while I go squirt with any cockle. When here who adolls <br />
me infuxes sleep. But if this could see with its backsight he’d <br />
be the grand old greeneyed lobster. He’s my first viewmarc since <br />
Valentine. Wink’s the winning word.</p>

<p>Luck!</p>

<p>In the house of breathings lies that word, all fairness. The walls <br />
are of rubinen and the glittergates of elfinbone. The roof herof is <br />
of massicious jasper and a canopy of Tyrian awning rises and <br />
still descends to it. A grape cluster of lights hangs therebeneath <br />
and all the house is filled with the breathings of her fairness, the <br />
fairness of fondance and the fairness of milk and rhubarb and the <br />
fairness of roasted meats and uniomargrits and the fairness of <br />
promise with consonantia and avowals. There lies her word, you <br />
reder! The height herup exalts it and the lowness her down aba- <br />
seth it. It vibroverberates upon the tegmen and prosplodes from <br />
pomoeria. A window, a hedge, a prong, a hand, an eye, a sign, a <br />
head and keep your other augur on her paypaypay. And you have <br />
it, old Sem, pat as ah be seated! And Sunny, my gander, he’s <br />
coming to land her. The boy which she now adores. She dores. <br />
Oh backed von dem zug! Make weg for their tug!</p>

<p>With a ring ding dong, they raise clasped hands and advance <br />
more steps to retire to the saum. Curtsey one, curtsey two, with <br />
arms akimbo, devotees.</p>

<p>Irrelevance.</p>

<p>All sing:
<span class="em">—</span>I rose up one maypole morning and saw in my glass how <br />
nobody loves me but you. Ugh. Ugh.</p>

<p>All point in the shem direction as if to shun.
<span class="em">—</span>My name is Misha Misha but call me Toffey Tough. I <br />
mean Mettenchough. It was her, boy the boy that was loft in the <br />
larch. Ogh! Ogh!</p>

<p>Her reverence.</p>

<p>All laugh.</p>

<p>They pretend to helf while they simply shauted at him sauce to <br />
make hims prich. And ith ith noth cricquette, Sally Lums. Not <br />
by ever such a lot. Twentynines of bloomers gegging een man<span></span></p>
