<p class="ni">name is on the hero, Capellisato, shoehanded slaughterer of the <br />
shader of our leaves.</p>

<p>Attach him! Hold!</p>

<p>Yet stir thee, to clay, Tamor!</p>

<p>Why wilt thou erewaken him from his earth, O summonor- <br />
other: he is weatherbitten from the dusts of ages? The hour of his <br />
closing hies to hand; the tocsin that shall claxonise his ware- <br />
abouts. If one who remembered his webgoods and tealofts were <br />
to ask of a hooper for whose it was the storks were quitting <br />
Aquileyria, this trundler would not wot; if other who joined faith <br />
when his depth charge bombed our barrel spillway were to —!</p>

<p>Jehosophat, what doom is here! Rain ruth on them, sire! The <br />
wing of Moykill cover him! The Bulljon Bossbrute quarantee <br />
him! Calavera, caution! Slaves to Virtue, save his Veritotem! <br />
Bearara Tolearis, procul abeat! The Ivorbonegorer of Danamara- <br />
ca be, his Hector Protector! Woldomar with Vasa, peel your <br />
peeps! And try to saviourise the nights of labour to the order of <br />
our blooding worold! While Pliny the Younger writes to Pliny <br />
the Elder his calamolumen of contumellas, what Aulus Gellius <br />
picked on Micmacrobius and what Vitruvius pocketed from <br />
Cassiodorus. Like we larnt from that Buke of Lukan in Dublin’s <br />
capital, Kongdam Coombe. Even if you are the kooper of the <br />
winkel over measure never lost a licence. Nor a duckindonche <br />
divulse from hath and breakfast. And for the honour of Alcohol <br />
drop that you-know-what-I’ve-come-about-I-saw-your-act air! <br />
Punch may be pottleproud but his Judy’s a wife’s wit better.</p>

<p>For the producer (Mr John Baptister Vickar) caused a deep <br />
abuliousness to descend upon the Father of Truants and, at a side <br />
issue, pluterpromptly brought on the scene the cutletsized con- <br />
sort, foundling filly of fortyshilling fostertailor and shipman’s <br />
shopahoyden, weighing ten pebble ten, scaling five footsy five <br />
and spanning thirtyseven inchettes round the good companions, <br />
twentynine ditties round the wishful waistress, thirtyseven alsos <br />
round the answer to everything, twentythree of the same round <br />
each of the quis separabits, fourteen round the beginning of hap- <br />
piness and nicely nine round her shoed for slender.</p>
