<p>And eher you could pray mercy to goodness or help with your <br />
hokey or mehokeypoo, Gallus’s hen has collared her pullets. <br />
That’s where they have owreglias for. Their bone of contention, <br />
flesh to their thorns, prest as Prestissima, makes off in a thinkling <br />
(and not one hen only nor two hens neyther but every blessed <br />
brigid came aclucking and aclacking), while, a rum a rum, the <br />
ram of all harns, Bier, Wijn, Spirituosen for consumption on the <br />
premises, advokaat withouten pleaders, Mas marrit, Pas poulit, <br />
Ras ruddist of all, though flamifestouned from galantifloures, is <br />
hued and cried of each’s colour.</p>

<p>Home all go. Halome. Blare no more ramsblares, oddmund <br />
barkes! And cease your fumings, kindalled bushies! And sherri- <br />
goldies yeassymgnays; your wildeshaweshowe moves swiftly <br />
sterneward! For here the holy language. Soons to come. To <br />
pausse.</p>

<p>’Tis goed. Het best.</p>

<p>For they are now tearing, that is, teartoretorning. Too soon <br />
are coming tasbooks and goody, hominy bread and bible bee, <br />
with jaggery-yo to juju-jaw, Fine’s French phrases from the <br />
Grandmere des Grammaires and bothered parsenaps from the <br />
Four Massores, Mattatias, Marusias, Lucanias, Jokinias, and what <br />
happened to our eleven in thirtytwo antepostdating the Valgur <br />
Eire and why is limbo where is he and what are the sound waves <br />
saying ceased ere they all wayed wrong and Amnist anguished <br />
axes Collis and where fishngaman fetched the mongafesh from <br />
and whatfor paddybird notplease rancoon and why was Sindat <br />
sitthing on him sitbom like a saildior, with what the doc did in the <br />
doil, not to mention define the hydraulics of common salt and, <br />
its denier crid of old provaunce, where G.P.O. is zentrum and <br />
D.U.T.C. are radients write down by the frequency of the scores <br />
and crores of your refractions the valuations in the pice of ding- <br />
gyings on N.C.R. and S.C.R.</p>

<p>That little cloud, a nibulissa, still hangs isky. Singabed sulks <br />
before slumber. Light at night has an alps on his druckhouse. <br />
Thick head and thin butter or after you with me. Caspi, but <br />
gueroligue stings the air. Gaylegs to riot of us! Gallocks to lafft!<span></span></p>
