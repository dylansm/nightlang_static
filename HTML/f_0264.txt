Honour commercio’s energy yet aid the  
linkless proud, the plurable with everybody  
and ech with pal, this ernst of Allsap’s ale  
halliday of roaring month with its two lunar  
eclipses and its three saturnine settings! Horn

glint of plaising height. This Norman court at  
boundary of the ville, yon creepered tower of

worshipful assemblage,[^3] with our king’s house%j%
