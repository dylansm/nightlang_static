ewes jilting about and the thrills and ills of laylock blossoms three’s so much <br />
more plants than chants for cecilies that I was thinking fairly killing times of <br />
putting an end to myself and my malody, when I remembered all your pupil- <br />
teacher’s erringnesses in perfection class. You sh’undn’t write you can’t if you <br />
w’udn’t pass for undevelopmented. This is the propper way to say that, Sr. If <br />
it’s me chews to swallow all you saidn’t you can eat my words for it as sure as <br />
there’s a key in my kiss. Quick erit faciofacey. When we will conjugate to- <br />

on, (here he inst, my lifstack, a newfolly likon) when I slip through my pettigo <br />
I’ll get my decree and take seidens when I’m not ploughed first by some <br />
Rolando the Lasso, and flaunt on the flimsyfilmsies for to grig my collage <br />
juniorees who, though they flush fuchsia, are they octette and virginity in my <br />
shade but always my figurants. They may be yea of my year but they’re nary <br />
nay of my day. Wait till spring has sprung in spickness and prigs beg in to pry <br />
they’ll be plentyprime of housepets to pimp and pamper my. Impending mar- <br />
riage. Nature tells everybody about but I learned all the runes of the gamest <br />
game ever from my old nourse Asa. A most adventuring trot is her and she <br />
vicking well knowed them all heartswise and fourwords. How Olive d’Oyly <br />
and Winnie Carr, bejupers, they reized the dressing of a salandmon and how a <br />
peeper costs and a salt sailor med a mustied poet atwaimen. It most have <br />
bean Mad Mullans planted him. Bina de Bisse and Trestrine von Terrefin. <br />
Sago sound, rite go round, kill kackle, kook kettle and (remember all should <br />
I forget to) bolt the thor. Auden. Wasn’t it just divining that dog of a dag <br />
in Skokholme as I sat astrid uppum their Drewitt’s altar, as cooledas as cul- <br />
cumbre, slapping my straights till the sloping ruins, postillion, postallion, a <br />
swinge a swank, with you offering me clouts of illscents and them horners <br />
stagstruck on the leasward! Don’t be of red, you blanching mench! This <br />
isabella I’m on knows the ruelles of the rut and she don’t fear andy mandy. So <br />
sing loud, sweet cheeriot, like anegreon in heaven! The good fother with the <br />
twingling in his eye will always have cakes in his pocket to bethroat us with <br />
for our allmichael good. Amum. Amum. And Amum again. For tough troth <br />
is stronger than fortuitous fiction and it’s the surplice money, oh my young <br />
friend and ah me sweet creature, what buys the bed while wits borrows the <br />
