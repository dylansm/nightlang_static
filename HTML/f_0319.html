<p class="ni">night for my lifting. Hillyhollow, valleylow! With the sounds <br />
and the scents in the morning.
<span class="em">—</span>I shot be shoddied, throttle me, fine me cowheel for ever, <br />
usquebauched the ersewild aleconner, for bringing briars to Bem- <br />
bracken and ringing rinbus round Demetrius for, as you wrinkle <br />
wryghtly, bully bluedomer, it’s a suirsite’s stircus haunting hes- <br />
teries round old volcanoes. We gin too gnir and thus plinary <br />
indulgence makes collemullas of us all. But Time is for talerman <br />
tasting his tap. Tiptoptap, Mister Maut.</p>

<p>He made one summery (Cholk and murble in lonestime) of his <br />
the three swallows like he was muzzling Moselems and torched <br />
up as the faery pangeant fluwed down the hisophenguts, a slake <br />
for the quicklining, to the tickle of his tube and the twobble of <br />
his fable, O, fibbing once upon a spray what a queer and queasy <br />
spree it was. Plumped.</p>

<p>Which both did. Prompt. Eh, chrystal holder? Save Ampster- <br />
dampster that had rheumaniscences in his netherlumbs.
<span class="em">—</span>By the drope in his groin, Ali Slupa, thinks the cappon, <br />
plumbing his liners, we were heretofore.
<span class="em">—</span>And be the coop of his gobbos, Reacher the Thaurd, thinks <br />
your girth fatter, apopo of his buckseaseilers, but where’s Horace’s <br />
courtin troopsers?
<span class="em">—</span>I put hem behind the oasthouse, sagd Pukkelsen, tuning <br />
wound on the teller, appeased to the cue, that double dyode <br />
dealered, and he’s wallowing awash swill of the Tarra water. And <br />
it marinned down his gargantast trombsathletic like the marousers of <br />
the gulpstroom. The kersse of Wolafs on him, shitateyar, he sagd in <br />
the fornicular, and, at weare or not at weare, I’m sigen no stretcher, <br />
for I carsed his murhersson goat in trotthers with them newbuckle- <br />
noosers behigh in the fire behame in the oasthouse. Hops! sagd he.
<span class="em">—</span>Smoke and coke choke! lauffed till the tear trickled drown a <br />
thigh the loafers all but a sheep’s whosepants that swished to the <br />
lord he hadn’t and the starer his story was talled to who felt that, <br />
the fierifornax being thurst on him motophosically, as Omar <br />
sometime notes, such a satuation, debauchly to be watched for, <br />
would empty dempty him down to the ground.</p>
