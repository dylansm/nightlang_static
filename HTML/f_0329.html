<p>And Dub did glow that night. In Fingal of victories. Cann- <br />
matha and Cathlin sang together. And the three shouters of <br />
glory. Yelling halfviewed their harps. Surly Tuhal smiled upon <br />
drear Darthoola: and Roscranna’s bolgaboyo begirlified the <br />
daughter of Cormac. The soul of everyelsesbody rolled into its <br />
olesoleself. A doublemonth’s licence, lease on mirth, while hooney- <br />
moon and her flame went huneysuckling. Holyryssia, what boom <br />
of bells! What battle of bragues on Sandgate where met the bobby <br />
mobbed his bibby mabbing through the ryce. Even Tombs left <br />
doss and dunnage down in Demidoff’s tomb and drew on the <br />
dournailed clogs that Morty Manning left him and legged in by <br />
Ghoststown Gate, like Pompei up to date, with a sprig of White- <br />
boys heather on his late Luke Elcock’s heirloom. And some say <br />

Paster de Grace on the Route de l’Epée. It was joobileejeu that <br />

You could hear them swearing threaties on the Cymylaya <br />
