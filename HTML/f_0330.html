<p class="ni">the Goat, that gafr, ate the Suenders bible. Hadn’t we heaven’s <br />
lamps to hide us? Yet every lane had its lively spark and every <br />
spark had its several spurtles and each spitfire spurtle had some <br />
trick of her trade, a tease for Ned, nook’s nestle for Fred and <br />
a peep at me mow for Peer Pol. So that Father Matt Hughes <br />
looked taytotally threbled. But Danno the Dane grimmed. Dune. <br />
’Twere yeg will elsecare doatty lanv meet they dewscent hyemn <br />
to cannons’ roar and rifles’ peal vill shantey soloweys sang! For <br />
there were no more Tyrrhanees and for Laxembraghs was pass- <br />
thecupper to Our Lader’s. And it was dim upon the floods only <br />
and there was day on all the ground.</p>

<p>Thus street spins legends while wharves woves tales but some <br />
family fewd felt a nick in their name. Old Vickers sate down on <br />
their airs and straightened the points of their lace. Red Rowleys <br />
popped out of their lairs and asked what was wrong with the <br />
race. Mick na Murrough used dripping in layers to shave <br />
all the furze off his face. The Burke-Lees and Coyle-Finns <br />
paid full feines for their sinns when the Cap and Miss Coolie <br />
were roped.</p>

<p>Rolloraped.</p>

<p>With her banbax hoist from holder, zig for zag through pool <br />
and polder, cheap, cheap, cheap and Laughing Jack, all augurs <br />
scorenning, see the Bolche your pictures motion and Kitzy <br />
Kleinsuessmein eloping for that holm in Finn’s Hotel Fiord, <br />
Nova Norening. Where they pulled down the kuddle and they <br />
made fray and if thee don’t look homey, well, that Dook can eye <br />
Mae.</p>

<p>He goat a berth. And she cot a manege. And wohl’s gorse <br />
mundom ganna wedst.</p>

<p>Knock knock. War’s where! Which war? The Twwinns. <br />
Knock knock. Woos without! Without what? An apple. Knock <br />
knock.</p>

<p>The kilder massed, one then and uhindred, (harefoot, birdy- <br />
hands, herringabone, beesknees), and they barneydansked a <br />
kathareen round to know the who and to show the howsome. <br />
Why was you hiding, moder of moders? And where was hunty,<span></span></p>
