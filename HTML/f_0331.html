<p class="ni">poppa the gun? Pointing up to skyless heaven like the spoon out <br />

ing ungoing, their seeming sames for though that liamstone <br />
deaf do his part there’s a windtreetop whipples the damp off the <br />

pied dewydress. Lludd hillmythey, we’re brimming to hear! The <br />
durst he did and the first she ever? Peganeen Bushe, this isn’t the <br />
polkar, catch as you cancan when high land fling! And you Tim <br />
Tommy Melooney, I’ll tittle your barents if you stick that pigpin <br />

<p>So in the names of the balder and of the sol and of the holli- <br />
