<p class="ni">only a pippappoff pigeon shoot that gracesold getrunner, the <br />
man of centuries, was bowled out by judge, jury and umpire at <br />
batman’s biff like a witchbefooled legate. Dupe.</p>

<p>His almonence being alaterelly in dispensation with his three <br />
oldher patrons’ aid, providencer’s divine cow to milkfeeding <br />
mleckman, bonafacies to solafides, what matter what all his <br />
freudzay or who holds his hat to harm him, let hutch just keep <br />
on under at being a vanished consinent and let annapal livibel <br />
prettily prattle a lude all her own. And be that semeliminal <br />
salmon solemonly angled, ingate and outgate. A truce to lovecalls, <br />
dulled in warclothes, maleybags, things and bleakhusen. Leave <br />
the letter that never begins to go find the latter that ever comes <br />
to end, written in smoke and blurred by mist and signed of <br />
solitude, sealed at night.</p>

<p>Simply. As says the mug in the middle, nay brian nay noel, <br />
ney billy ney boney. Imagine twee cweamy wosen. Suppwose <br />
you get a beautiful thought and cull them sylvias sub silence. <br />
Then inmaggin a stotterer. Suppoutre him to been one bigger- <br />
master Omnibil. Then lustily (tutu the font and tritt on the boks- <br />
woods like gay feeters’s dance) immengine up to three longly <br />
lurking lobstarts. Fair instents the Will Woolsley Wellaslayers. <br />
Pet her, pink him, play pranks with them. She will nod ampro- <br />
perly smile. He may seem to appraisiate it. They are as piractical <br />
jukersmen sure to paltipsypote. Feel the wollies drippeling out <br />
of your fingathumbs. Says to youssilves (floweers have ears, <br />
heahear!) solowly: So these ease Budlim! How do, dainty dau- <br />
limbs? So peached to pick on you in this way, prue and simple, <br />
pritt and spry! Heyday too, Malster Faunagon, and hopes your <br />
hahititahiti licks the mankey nuts! And oodlum hoodlum dood- <br />
lum to yes, Donn, Teague and Hurleg, who the bullocks brought <br />
you here and how the hillocks are ye?</p>

<p>We want Bud. We want Bud Budderly. We want Bud Budderly <br />
boddily. There he is in his Borrisalooner. The man that shunned <br />
the rucks on Gereland. The man thut won the bettlle of the <br />
bawll. Order, order, order, order! And tough. We call on Tan- <br />
cred Artaxerxes Flavin to compeer with Barnabas Ulick Dunne.<span></span></p>
