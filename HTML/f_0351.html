<p class="ni">us victorias with nowells and brownings, dumm, sneak and <br />
curry, and all the fun I had in that fanagan’s week. A strange <br />
man wearing abarrel. And here’s a gift of meggs and teggs. And <br />
as I live by chipping nortons. And ’tis iron fits the farmer, ay. <br />
Arcdesedo! Renborumba! Then were the hellscyown days for <br />
our fellows, the loyal leibsters, and we was the redugout raw- <br />
recruitioners, praddies three and prettish too, a wheeze we has <br />
in our waynward islands, wee engrish, one long blue streak, <br />
jisty and pithy af durck rosolun, with hand to hand as Homard <br />
Kayenne was always jiggilyjugging about in his wendowed <br />
courage when our woos with the wenches went wined for a song, <br />
tsingirillies’ zyngarettes, while Woodbine Willie, so popiular <br />
with the poppyrossies, our Chorney Choplain, blued the air. <br />
Sczlanthas! Banzaine! Bissbasses! S. Pivorandbowl. And we all <br />
tuned in to hear the topmast noviality. Up the revels drown the <br />
rinks and almistips allround! Paddy Bonhamme he vives! En- <br />
core! And tig for tag Togatogtug. My droomodose days Y loved <br />
you abover all the strest. Blowhole brasshat and boy with his <br />
boots off and the butch of our bunch and all. It was buckoo <br />
bonzer, beleeme. I was a bare prive without my doglegs but I <br />
did not give to one humpenny dump, wingh or wangh, touching <br />
those thusengaged slavey generales of Tanah Kornalls, the <br />
meelisha’s deelishas, pronouncing their very flank movemens <br />
in sunpictorsbosk. Baghus the whatwar! I could always take good <br />
cover of myself and, eyedulls or earwakers, preyers for rain or <br />
cominations, I did not care three tanker’s hoots, (’sham! hem! <br />
or chaffit!) for any feelings from my lifeprivates on their reptro- <br />
grad leanins because I have Their Honours booth my respectables <br />
sœurs assistershood off Lyndhurst Terrace, the puttih Misses <br />
Celana Dalems, and she in vinting her angurr can belle the troth <br />
on her alliance and I know His Heriness, my respeaktoble me- <br />
dams culonelle on Mellay Street, Lightnints Gundhur Sawabs, <br />
and they would never as the aimees of servation let me down. <br />
Not on your bludger life, touters! No peeping, pimpadoors! <br />
And, by Jova I never went wrong nor let him doom till, risky <br />
wark rasky wolk, at the head of the wake, up come stumblebum<span></span></p>
