won is nought, twigs too is nil, tricks trees makes nix, fairs fears <br />
stoops at nothing. And till Arthur comes againus and sen pea- <br />
trick’s he’s reformed we’ll pose him together a piece, a pace. <br />
Shares in guineases! There’s lovely the sight! Surey me, man <br />
weepful! Big Seat, you did hear? And teach him twisters in <br />
tongue irish. Pat lad may goh too. Quicken, aspen;ash and yew; <br />
willow, broom with oak for you. And move your tellabout. Not <br />
nice is that, limpet lady! Spose we try it promissly. Love all. <br />
Naytellmeknot tennis! Taunt me treattening! But do now say to <br />
Mr Eustache! Ingean mingen has to hear. Whose joint is out of <br />
jealousy now? Why, heavilybody’s evillyboldy’s. Hopping Gra- <br />
cius, onthy ovful! O belessk mie, what a nerve! How a mans in <br />

bridge of primerose and his twy Isas Boldmans is met the bluey- <br />
bells near Dandeliond. We think its a gorsedd shame, these go- <br />
doms. A lark of limonladies! A lurk of orangetawneymen! You’re <br />
backleg wounted, budkley mister, bester of the boyne!</p>

<p>And they leaved the most leavely of leaftimes and the most <br />
folliagenous till there came the marrer of mirth and the jangthe- <br />
rapper of all jocolarinas and they were as were they never ere. <br />
Yet had they laughtered, one on other, undo the end and enjoyed <br />
their laughings merry was the times when so grant it High Hila- <br />
