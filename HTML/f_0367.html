<p class="ni">mim. Look at Lokman! Whatbetween the cupgirls and the <br />
platterboys. And he grew back into his grossery baseness: and <br />

pleas pink, how to pleas pink.</p>

<p>Punk.</p>

<p>Mask one. Mask two. Mask three. Mask four.</p>

<p>Up.
<span class="em">—</span>Look about you, Tutty Comyn!
<span class="em">—</span>Remember and recall, Kullykeg!
<span class="em">—</span>When visiting Dan Leary try the corner house for thee.

Our four avunculusts.</p>

<p>And, since threestory sorratelling was much too many, they <br />
maddened and they morgued and they lungd and they jowld. <br />
Synopticked on the word. <br />
Till the Juke done it.</p>

<p>Down.</p>

<p>Like Jukoleon, the seagoer, when he bore down in his perry <br />
boat he had raised a slide and shipped his orders and seized his <br />
pullets and primed their plumages, the fionnling and dubhlet, the <br />
dun and the fire, and, sending them one by other to fare fore fom, <br />
he had behold the residuance of a delugion: the foggy doze still <br />
going strong, the old thalassocrats of invinsible empores, maskers <br />
of the waterworld, facing one way to another way and this way <br />
on that way, from severalled their fourdimmansions. Where the <br />
lighning leaps from the numbulous; where coold by cawld breide <br />
lieth langwid; the bounds whereinbourne our solied bodies all <br />
attomed attaim arrest: appoint, that’s all. But see what follows. <br />
Wringlings upon wronglings among incomputables about an <br />
uncomeoutable (an angel prophetethis? kingcorrier of beheasts? <br />
the calif in his halifskin? that eyriewinging one?) and the voids <br />
bubbily vode’s dodos across the which the boomomouths from <br />
their dupest dupes were in envery and anononously blowing <br />
great.</p>
