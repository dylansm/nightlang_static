<p>Guns.</p>

<p>Keep backwards, please, because there was no good to gundy <br />
running up again. Guns. And it was written up in big capital. <br />
Guns. Saying never underrupt greatgrandgosterfosters! Guns. <br />
And whatever one did they said, the fourlings, that on no acounts <br />
you were not to. Guns.</p>

<p>Not to pad them behaunt in the fear. Not to go, tonnerwatter, <br />
and bungley well chute the rising gianerant. Not to wandly be <br />
woking around jerumsalemdo at small hours about the murketplots, <br />
smelling okey boney, this little figgy and arraky belloky this little <br />
pink into porker but, porkodirto, to let the gentlemen pedesta- <br />
rolies out of the Monabella culculpuration live his own left leave, <br />
cullebuone, by perperusual of the petpubblicities without inwok- <br />
ing his also’s between (sic) the arraky bone and (suc) the okey <br />
bellock. And not to not be always, hemmer and hummer, treeing <br />
unselves up with one exite but not to never be caving nicely, pre- <br />
cisely, quicely, rebustly, tendrolly, unremarkably, forsakenly, hal- <br />
tedly, reputedly, firstly, somewhatly, yesayenolly about the back <br />
excits. Never to weaken up in place of the broths. Never to vvol- <br />
lusslleepp in the pleece of the poots. And, allerthings, never to ate <br />
the sour deans if they weren’t having anysin on their consients. <br />
And, when in Zumschloss, to never, narks, cease till the finely <br />
ending was consummated by the completion of accomplishment.</p>

<p>And thus within the tavern’s secret booth The wisehight ones <br />
who sip the tested sooth Bestir them as the Just has bid to jab The <br />
punch of quaram on the mug of truth.</p>

<p>K.C. jowls, they’re sodden in the secret. K.C. jowls, they sure <br />
are wise. K.C. jowls, the justicestjobbers, for they’ll find another <br />
faller if their ruse won’t rise. Whooley the Whooper.</p>

<p>There is to see. Squarish large face with the atlas jacket. Brights, <br />
brownie eyes in bluesackin shoeings. Peaky booky nose over a <br />
lousiany shirt. Ruddy stackle hair besides a strawcamel belt. <br />
Namely. Gregorovitch, Leonocopolos, Tarpinacci and Duggel- <br />
duggel. And was theys stare all atime? Yea but they was. Andor- <br />
ing the games, induring the studies, undaring the stories, end all. <br />
Ned? Only snugged then and cosied after one percepted nought<span></span></p>
