<p class="ni">in your flesh. To tell how your mead of, mard, is made of. All old <br />
Dadgerson’s dodges one conning one’s copying and that’s what <br />
wonderland’s wanderlad’ll flaunt to the fair. A trancedone boy- <br />
script with tittivits by. Ahem. You’ll read it tomorrow, marn, <br />
when the curds on the table. A nigg for a nogg and a thrate for <br />
a throte. The auditor learns. Still pumping on Torkenwhite Rad- <br />
lumps, Lencs. In preplays to Anonymay’s left hinted palinode <br />
obviously inspiterebbed by a sibspecious connexion. Note the <br />
notes of admiration! See the signs of suspicion! Count the hemi- <br />
semidemicolons! Screamer caps and invented gommas, quoites <br />
puntlost, forced to farce! The pipette will say anything at all for <br />
a change. And you know what aglove means in the Murdrus due- <br />
luct! Fewer to feud and rompant culotticism, a fugle for the glee- <br />
men and save, sit and sew. And a pants outsizinned on the <br />
Doughertys’ duckboard pointing to peace at home. In some, <br />
lawanorder on lovinardor. Wait till we hear the Boy of Biskop <br />
reeling around your postoral lector! Epistlemadethemology for <br />
deep dorfy doubtlings. As we’ll lay till break of day in the bunk of <br />
basky, O! Our island, Rome and duty! Well tried, buckstiff! Batt <br />
in, boot! Sell him a breach contact, the vendoror, the buylawyer <br />
One hyde, sack, hic! Two stick holst, Lucky! Finnish Make Goal! <br />
First you were Nomad, next you were Namar, now you’re Nu- <br />
mah and it’s soon you’ll be Nomon. Hence counsels Ecclesiast. <br />
There’s every resumption. The forgein offils is on the shove to <br />
lay you out dossier. Darby’s in the yard, planning it on you, plot <br />
and edgings, the whispering peeler after cooks wearing an illfor- <br />
mation. The find of his kind! An artist, sir! And dirt cheap at <br />
a sovereign a skull! He knows his Finsbury Follies backwoods <br />
so you batter see to your regent refutation. Ascare winde is rifing <br />
again about nice boys going native. You know who was wrote <br />
about in the Orange Book of Estchapel? Basil and the two other <br />
men from King’s Avenance. Just press this cold brand against <br />
your brow for a mow. Cainfully! The sinus the curse. That’s it. <br />
Hung Chung Egglyfella now speak he tell numptywumpty top- <br />

covered not. How you fell from story to story like a sagasand<span></span></p>
