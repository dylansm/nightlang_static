finger a fudding in pudding and pie. And here’s the witnesses. <br />
Glue on to him, Greevy! Bottom anker, Noordeece! And kick <br />
kick killykick for the house that juke built! Wait till they send <br />
you to sleep, scowpow! By jurors’ cruces! Then old Hunphy- <br />
dunphyville’ll be blasted to bumboards by the youthful herald <br />
who would once you were. He’d be our chosen one in the matter <br />
of Brittas more than anarthur. But we’ll wake and see. The wholes <br />
poors riches of ours hundreds of manhoods and womhoods. Two <br />
cents, two mills and two myrds. And it’s all us rangers you’ll be <br />
facing in the box before the twelfth correctional. Like one man, <br />
gell. Between all the Misses Mountsackvilles in their halfmoon <br />
haemicycles, gasping to giddies to dye for the shame. Just hold <br />

and little Mrs Ex-Skaerer-Sissers is bribing the halfpricers to pray <br />
for her widower in his gravest embazzlement. You on her, hosy <br />
jigses, that’ll be some nonstop marrimont! You in your stolen <br />

a dat of dew. Between Furr-y-Benn and Ferr-y-Bree. In this tear <br />
Vikloe vich he lofed. The smiling ever. If you pulls me over pay <br />
