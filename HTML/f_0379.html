Treaclyshortcake with Bugle and the Bitch pairsadrawsing and <br />
Horssmayres Prosession tyghting up under the threes. Stop. <br />
Press stop. To press stop. All to press stop. And be the seem <br />
talkin wharabahts hosetanzies, dat sure is sullibrated word! Bing <br />
bong! Saxolooter, for congesters are salders’ prey. Snap it up in <br />
the loose, patchy the blank! Anyone can see you’re the son of a <br />
gunnell. Fellow him up too, Carlow! Woes to the worm- <br />
quashed, aye, and wor to the winner! Think of Aerian’s Wall and <br />
the Fall of Toss. Give him another for to volleyholleydoodlem! <br />
His lights not all out yet, the liverpooser! Boohoohoo it oose! <br />
With seven hores always in the home of his thinkingthings, his <br />
nodsloddledome of his noiselisslesoughts. Two Idas, two Evas, <br />
two Nessies and Rubyjuby. Phook! No wonder, pipes as kirles, <br />
that he sthings like a rheinbok. One bed night he had the dely- <br />
siums that they were all queens mobbing him. Fell stiff. Oh, <br />
ho, ho, ho, ah, he, he! Abedicate yourself It just gegs our goad. <br />
He’ll be the deaf of us, pappappoppopcuddle, samblind daiy- <br />

your Meggers a B E N K B A N K B O N K to sloop in with <br />
all sorts of adceterus and adsaturas. It’s our last fight, Megantic, <br />

There goes the blackwatchwomen, all in white, flaxed up, pur- <br />
gad! Right toe, Armitage! Tem for Tam at Timmotty Hall! <br />
We’re been carried away. Beyond bournes and bowers. So we’ll <br />
