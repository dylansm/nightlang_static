and the wild geese and the gannets and the migratories and the <br />
mistlethrushes and the auspices and all the birds of the rockby- <br />
suckerassousyoceanal sea, all four of them, all sighing and sob- <br />
bing, and listening. Moykle ahoykling!</p>

<p>They were the big four, the four maaster waves of Erin, all <br />
listening, four. There was old Matt Gregory and then besides old <br />
Matt there was old Marcus Lyons, the four waves, and oftentimes <br />
they used to be saying grace together, right enough, bausnabeatha, <br />
in Miracle Squeer: here now we are the four of us: old Matt Gre- <br />
gory and old Marcus and old Luke Tarpey: the four of us and <br />
sure, thank God, there are no more of us: and, sure now, you <br />
wouldn’t go and forget and leave out the other fellow and old <br />
Johnny MacDougall: the four of us and no more of us and so <br />
now pass the fish for Christ sake, Amen: the way they used to be <br />
saying their grace before fish, repeating itself, after the interims <br />
of Augusburgh for auld lang syne. And so there they were, with <br />
their palms in their hands, like the pulchrum’s proculs, spraining <br />
their ears, luistening and listening to the oceans of kissening, with <br />
their eyes glistening, all the four, when he was kiddling and <br />
cuddling and bunnyhugging scrumptious his colleen bawn and <br />
dinkum belle, an oscar sister, on the fifteen inch loveseat, behind <br />
the chieftaness stewardesses cubin, the hero, of Gaelic champion, <br />
the onliest one of her choice, her bleaueyedeal of a girl’s friend, <br />
neither bigugly nor smallnice, meaning pretty much everything <br />
to her then, with his sinister dexterity, light and rufthandling, <br />
vicemversem her ragbags et assaucyetiams, fore and aft, on and <br />
offsides, the brueburnt sexfutter, handson and huntsem, that was <br />
palpably wrong and bulbubly improper, and cuddling her and <br />
kissing her, tootyfay charmaunt, in her ensemble of maidenna <br />
blue, with an overdress of net, tickled with goldies, Isolamisola, <br />
and whisping and lisping her about Trisolanisans, how one was <br />
whips for one was two and two was lips for one was three, and <br />
dissimulating themself, with his poghue like Arrah-na-poghue, <br />
the dear dear annual, they all four remembored who made the <br />
world and how they used to be at that time in the vulgar ear<span></span></p>
