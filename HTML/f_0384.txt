They were the big four, the four maaster waves of Erin, all  
listening, four. There was old Matt Gregory and then besides old  
Matt there was old Marcus Lyons, the four waves, and oftentimes  
they used to be saying grace together, right enough, bausnabeatha,  
in Miracle Squeer: here now we are the four of us: old Matt Gre-  
gory and old Marcus and old Luke Tarpey: the four of us and  
sure, thank God, there are no more of us: and, sure now, you  
wouldn’t go and forget and leave out the other fellow and old  
Johnny MacDougall: the four of us and no more of us and so  
now pass the fish for Christ sake, Amen: the way they used to be  
saying their grace before fish, repeating itself, after the interims  
of Augusburgh for auld lang syne. And so there they were, with  
their palms in their hands, like the pulchrum’s proculs, spraining  
their ears, luistening and listening to the oceans of kissening, with

neither bigugly nor smallnice, meaning pretty much everything  
to her then, with his sinister dexterity, light and rufthandling,  
vicemversem her ragbags et assaucyetiams, fore and aft, on and  
offsides, the brueburnt sexfutter, handson and huntsem, that was  
palpably wrong and bulbubly improper, and cuddling her and  
kissing her, tootyfay charmaunt, in her ensemble of maidenna  
blue, with an overdress of net, tickled with goldies, Isolamisola,  
and whisping and lisping her about Trisolanisans, how one was  
whips for one was two and two was lips for one was three, and  
dissimulating themself, with his poghue like Arrah-na-poghue,  
the dear dear annual, they all four remembored who made the  
world and how they used to be at that time in the vulgar ear%j%
