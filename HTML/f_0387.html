his amber necklace and his crimson harness and his leathern jib <br />

christening of Queen Baltersby, the Fourth Buzzersbee, accord- <br />

then there was the drowning of Pharoah and all his pedestrians <br />
and they were all completely drowned into the sea, the red sea, <br />
and then poor Merkin Cornyngwham, the official out of the <br />
castle on pension, when he was completely drowned off Erin <br />
Isles, at that time, suir knows, in the red sea and a lovely <br />
