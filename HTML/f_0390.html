<p class="ni">Newslaters and the mossacre of Saint Brices, to forget the past, <br />
when the burglar he shoved the wretch in churneroil, and con- <br />
tradicting all about Lally, the ballest master of Gosterstown, and <br />
his old fellow, the Lagener, in the Locklane Lighthouse, earing his <br />
wick with a pierce of railing, and liggen hig with his ladder up, and <br />
that oldtime turner and his sadderday erely cloudsing, the old <br />
croniony, Skelly, with the lether belly, full of neltts, full of keltts, <br />
full of lightweight beltts and all the bald drakes or ever he had up <br />
in the bohereen, off Artsichekes Road, with Moels and Mahmullagh <br />
Mullarty, the man in the Oran mosque, and the old folks at home <br />
and Duignan and Lapole and the grand confarreation, as per the <br />
cabbangers richestore, of the filest archives, and he couldn’t stop <br />
laughing over Tom Tim Tarpey, the Welshman, and the four <br />
middleaged widowers, all nangles, sangles, angles and wangles. <br />
And now, that reminds me, not to forget the four of the Welsh <br />
waves, leaping laughing, in their Lumbag Walk, over old Battle- <br />
shore and Deaddleconchs, in their half a Roman hat, with an an- <br />
cient Greek gloss on it, in Chichester College auction and, thank <br />
God, they were all summarily divorced, four years before, or so <br />
they say, by their dear poor shehusbands, in dear byword days, <br />
and never brought to mind, to see no more the rainwater on the <br />
floor but still they parted, raining water laughing, per Nupiter <br />
Privius, only terpary, on the best of terms and be forgot, whilk was <br />
plainly foretolk by their old pilgrim cocklesong or they were sing- <br />
ing through the wettest indies As I was going to Burrymecarott we <br />
fell in with a lout by the name of Peebles as also in another place by <br />
their orthodox proverb so there was said thus That old fellow <br />
knows milk though he’s not used to it latterly. And so they parted. <br />
In Dalkymont nember to. Ay, ay. The good go and the wicked <br />
is left over. As evil flows so Ivel flows. Ay, ay. Ah, well sure, <br />
that’s the way. As the holymaid of Kunut said to the haryman <br />
of Koombe. For his humple pesition in odvices. Woman. Squash. <br />
Part. Ay, ay. By decree absolute.</p>

Carpery of the Goold Fins was in the kingship of Poolland, Mrs <br />
