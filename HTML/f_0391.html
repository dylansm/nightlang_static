year of buy in disgrace 1132 or 1169 or 1768 Y.W.C.A., at the <br />
Married Male Familyman’s Auctioneer’s court in Arrahnacuddle. <br />
Poor Johnny of the clan of the Dougals, the poor Scuitsman, <br />
(Hohannes!) nothing if not amorous, dinna forget, so frightened <br />
(Zweep! Zweep!) on account of her full bottom, (undullable <br />
attraxity!) that put the yearl of mercies on him, and the four <br />
maasters, in chors, with a hing behangd them, because he was <br />
so slow to borstel her schoon for her, when he was grooming her <br />
ladyship, instead of backscratching her materfamilias proper, like <br />
any old methodist, and all divorced and innasense interdict, in <br />

dumb upon your Ire, as we say in the Spasms of Davies, and we <br />
won’t be too hard on him as an old Manx presbyterian) and after <br />
that, as red as a Rosse is, he made his last will and went to con- <br />

on his two bare marrowbones, to Her Worship his Mother and <br />
Sister Evangelist Sweainey, on Cailcainnin widnight and he was <br />
