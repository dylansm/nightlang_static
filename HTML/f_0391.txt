year of buy in disgrace 1132 or 1169 or 1768 Y.W.C.A., at the  
Married Male Familyman’s Auctioneer’s court in Arrahnacuddle.  
Poor Johnny of the clan of the Dougals, the poor Scuitsman,  
(Hohannes!) nothing if not amorous, dinna forget, so frightened  
(Zweep! Zweep!) on account of her full bottom, (undullable  
attraxity!) that put the yearl of mercies on him, and the four  
maasters, in chors, with a hing behangd them, because he was  
so slow to borstel her schoon for her, when he was grooming her
