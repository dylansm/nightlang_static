<p>And now, upright and add them! And plays be honest! And <br />
pullit into yourself, as on manowoman do another! Candidately, <br />

Irish prisscess, so and so hands high, such and such paddock <br />
weight, in her madapolam smock, nothing under her hat but <br />
red hair and solid ivory (now you know it’s true in your <br />
hardup hearts!) and a firstclass pair of bedroom eyes, of most <br />
unhomy blue, (how weak we are, one and all!) the charm <br />

<p>Ah now, it was tootwoly torrific, the mummurrlubejubes! And <br />
