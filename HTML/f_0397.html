<p class="ni">maiden name, for overflauwing, by the dream of woman the <br />
owneirist, in forty lands. From Greg and Doug on poor Greg <br />
and Mat and Mar and Lu and Jo, now happily buried, our four! <br />
And there she was right enough, that lovely sight enough, the <br />
girleen bawn asthore, as for days galore, of planxty Gregory. <br />
Egory. O bunket not Orwin! Ay, ay.</p>

<p>But, sure, that reminds me now, like another tellmastory re- <br />
peating yourself, how they used to be in lethargy’s love, at the <br />
end of it all, at that time (up) always, tired and all, after doing the <br />
mousework and making it up, over their community singing <br />
(up) the top loft of the voicebox, of Mamalujo like the senior <br />
follies at murther magrees, squatting round, two by two, the four <br />
confederates, with Caxons the Coswarn, up the wet air register <br />
in Old Man’s House, Millenium Road, crowning themselves in <br />
lauraly branches, with their cold knees and their poor (up) quad <br />
rupeds, ovasleep, and all dolled up, for their blankets and materny <br />
mufflers and plimsoles and their bowl of brown shackle and <br />
milky and boterham clots, a potion a peace, a piece aportion, a <br />
lepel alip, alup a lap, for a cup of kindest yet, with hold take hand <br />
and nurse and only touch of ate, a lovely munkybown and for <br />
xmell and wait the pinch and prompt poor Marcus Lyons to be not <br />
beheeding the skillet on for the live of ghosses but to pass the teeth <br />
for choke sake, Amensch, when it so happen they were all syca- <br />
more and by the world forgot, since the phlegmish hoopicough, <br />
for all a possabled, after ete a bad cramp and johnny magories, and <br />
backscrat the poor bedsores and the farthing dip, their caschal <br />
pandle of magnegnousioum, and read a letter or two every night, <br />
before going to dodo sleep atrance, with their catkins coifs, in <br />
the twilight, a capitaletter, for further auspices, on their old one <br />
page codex book of old year’s eve 1132, M.M.L.J. old style, their <br />
Senchus Mor, by his fellow girl, the Mrs Shemans, in her summer <br />
seal houseonsample, with the caracul broadtail, her totam in <br />
tutu, final buff noonmeal edition, in the regatta covers, uptenable <br />
from the orther, for to regul their reves by incubation, and Lally, <br />
through their gangrene spentacles, and all the good or they <br />
did in their time, the rigorists, for Roe and O’Mulcnory a<span></span></p>
