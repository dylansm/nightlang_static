<p class="ni">And no damn loutll come courting thee or by the mother of the Holy <br />
Ghost there’ll be murder!</p>

<p>O, come all ye sweet nymphs of Dingle beach to cheer Brinabride <br />
queen from Sybil surfriding <br />
In her curragh of shells of daughter of pearl and her silverymonnblue <br />
mantle round her. <br />
Crown of the waters, brine on her brow, she’ll dance them a jig and <br />
jilt them fairly. <br />
Yerra, why would she bide with Sig Sloomysides or the grogram grey <br />
barnacle gander?</p>

<p>You won’t need be lonesome, Lizzy my love, when your beau gets his <br />
glut of cold meat and hot soldiering <br />
Nor wake in winter, window machree, but snore sung in my old <br />
Balbriggan surtout. <br />
Wisha, won’t you agree now to take me from the middle, say, of <br />
next week on, for the balance of my days, for nothing (what?) <br />
as your own nursetender? <br />
A power of highsteppers died game right enough<span class="em">—</span>but who, acushla, <br />
’ll beg coppers for you?</p>

<p>I tossed that one long before anyone. <br />
It was of a wet good Friday too she was ironing and, as I’m given <br />
now to understand, she was always mad gone on me. <br />
Grand goosegreasing we had entirely with an allnight eiderdown bed <br />
picnic to follow. <br />
By the cross of Cong, says she, rising up Saturday in the twilight <br />
from under me, Mick, Nick the Maggot or whatever your name <br />
is, you’re the mose likable lad that’s come my ways yet from the <br />
barony of Bohermore.</p>

<p>Mattheehew, Markeehew, Lukeehew, Johnheehewheehew! <br />
Haw! <br />
And still a light moves long the river. And stiller the mermen <br />
ply their keg. <br />
Its pith is full. The way is free. Their lot is cast. <br />
So, to john for a john, johnajeams, led it be!</p>
