%ni%And no damn loutll come courting thee or by the mother of the Holy  
Ghost there’ll be murder!

O, come all ye sweet nymphs of Dingle beach to cheer Brinabride  
queen from Sybil surfriding  
In her curragh of shells of daughter of pearl and her silverymonnblue  
mantle round her.  
Crown of the waters, brine on her brow, she’ll dance them a jig and  
jilt them fairly.  
Yerra, why would she bide with Sig Sloomysides or the grogram grey  
barnacle gander?

You won’t need be lonesome, Lizzy my love, when your beau gets his

is, you’re the mose likable lad that’s come my ways yet from the  
barony of Bohermore.

Mattheehew, Markeehew, Lukeehew, Johnheehewheehew!  
Haw!  
And still a light moves long the river. And stiller the mermen  
ply their keg.  
Its pith is full. The way is free. Their lot is cast.  
So, to john for a john, johnajeams, led it be!
