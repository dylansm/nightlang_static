<p class="ni">gleam darkling adown surface of affluvial flowandflow as again <br />
might seem garments of laundry reposing a leasward close at <br />
hand in full expectation. And as I was jogging along in a dream as <br />
dozing I was dawdling, arrah, methought broadtone was heard and <br />
the creepers and the gliders and flivvers of the earth breath and <br />
the dancetongues of the woodfires and the hummers in their <br />
ground all vociferated echoating: Shaun! Shaun! Post the post! <br />
with a high voice and O, the higher on high the deeper and low, <br />
I heard him so! And lo, mescemed somewhat came of the noise <br />
and somewho might amove allmurk. Now, ’twas as clump, now <br />

his jacket of providence wellprovided woolies with a softrolling <br />
lisp of a lapel to it and great sealingwax buttons, a good helping <br />
bigger than the slots for them, of twentytwo carrot krasnapopp- <br />
sky red and his invulnerable burlap whiskcoat and his popular <br />
choker, Tamagnum sette-and-forte and his loud boheem toy and <br />
the damasker’s overshirt he sported inside, a starspangled zephyr <br />
with a decidedly surpliced crinklydoodle front with his motto <br />
through dear life embrothred over it in peas, rice, and yeggy- <br />
yolk, Or for royal, Am for Mail, R.M.D. hard cash on the nail <br />
