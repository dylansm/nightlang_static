<p class="ni">came along merendally his stockpot dinner of a half a pound or <br />
round steak, very rare, Blong’s best from Portarlington’s Butchery, <br />
with a side of riceypeasy and Corkshire alla mellonge and bacon <br />
with (a little mar pliche!) a pair of chops and thrown in from the <br />
silver grid by the proprietoress of the roastery who lives on the <br />
hill and gaulusch gravy and pumpernickel to wolp up and a <br />
gorger’s bulby onion (Margareter, Margaretar Margarastican- <br />
deatar) and as well with second course and then finally, after <br />
his avalunch oclock snack at’ Appelredt’s or Kitzy Braten’s of <br />
saddlebag steak and a Botherhim with her old phoenix portar, <br />
jistr to gwen his gwistel and praties sweet and Irish too and mock <br />
gurgle to whistle his way through for the swallying, swp by swp, <br />
and he getting his tongue arount it and Boland’s broth broken <br />
into the bargain, to his regret his soupay avic nightcap, vitellusit, <br />
a carusal consistent with second course eyer and becon (the rich <br />
of) with broad beans, hig, steak, hag, pepper the diamond bone <br />
hotted up timmtomm and while’twas after that he scoffed a drake- <br />
ling snuggily stuffed following cold loin of veal more cabbage and <br />
in their green free state a clister of peas, soppositorily petty, last. <br />
P.S. but a fingerhot of rheingenever to give the Pax cum Spiri- <br />
tututu. Drily thankful. Burud and dulse and typureely jam, all <br />
free of charge, aman, and. And the best of wine avec. For his <br />
heart was as big as himself, so it was, ay, and bigger! While the <br />
loaves are aflowering and the nachtingale jugs. All St Jilian’s of <br />
Berry, hurrah there for tobies! Mabhrodaphne, brown pride of our <br />
custard house quay, amiable with repastful, cheerus graciously, <br />
cheer us! Ever of thee, Anne Lynch, he’s deeply draiming! <br />
Houseanna! Tea is the Highest! For auld lang Ayternitay! Thus <br />
thicker will he grow now, grew new. And better and better on <br />
butterand butter. At the sign of Mesthress Vanhungrig. However! <br />
Mind you, nuckling down to nourritures, were they menuly some <br />
ham and jaffas, and I don’t mean to make the ingestion for the <br />
moment that he was guilbey of gulpable gluttony as regards chew- <br />
able boltaballs, but, biestings be biestings, and upon the whole, <br />
