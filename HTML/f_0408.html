moistened his manducators upon the quiet and scooping molars <br />
and grinders clean with his two fore fingers, he sank his hunk, <br />
dowanouet to resk at once, exhaust as winded hare, utterly spent, <br />
it was all he could do (disgusted with himself that the combined <br />
weight of his tons of iosals was a hundred men’s massed too much <br />
for him), upon the native heath he loved covered kneehigh with <br />
virgin bush, for who who e’er trod sod of Erin could ever sleep <br />
off the turf! Well, I’m liberally dished seeing myself in this trim! <br />
How all too unwordy am I, a mere mailman of peace, a poor loust <br />
hastehater of the first degree, the principot of Candia, no legs and <br />
a title, for such eminence, or unpro promenade rather, to be much <br />
more exact, as to be the bearer extraordinary of these postoomany <br />
missive on his majesty’s service while me and yous and them we’re <br />
extending us after the pattern of reposiveness! Weh is me, yeh is <br />
ye! I, the mightif beam maircanny, which bit his mirth too early <br />
or met his birth too late! It should of been my other with his <br />

I’m very fond of that other of mine. Fish hands Macsorley! <br />
Elien! Obsequies! Bonzeye! Isaac Egari’s Ass! We’re the music- <br />

But he’ such a game loser! I lift my disk to him. Brass and reeds, <br />
