<p class="ni">Wouldndom! But, Gemini, he’s looking frightfully thin! I heard <br />
the man Shee shinging in the pantry bay. Down among the dust- <br />
bins let him lie! Ear! Ear! Not ay! Eye! Eye! For I’m at the heart <br />
of it. Yet I cannot on my solemn merits as a recitativer recollect <br />
ever having done of anything of the kind to deserve of such. <br />
Not the phost of a nation! Nor by a long trollop! I just didn’t have <br />
the time to. Saint Anthony Guide!
<span class="em">—</span>But have we until now ever besought you, dear Shaun, we <br />
remembered, who it was, good boy, to begin with, who out of <br />
symphony gave you the permit?
<span class="em">—</span>Goodbye now, Shaun replied, with a voice pure as a church- <br />
mode, in echo rightdainty, with a good catlick tug at his coco- <br />
moss candylock, a foretaste in time of his cabbageous brain’s <br />
curlyflower. Athiacaro! Comb his tar odd gee sing your mower <br />
O meeow? Greet thee Good? How are them columbuses! Lard <br />
have mustard on them! Fatiguing, very fatiguing. Hobos hom- <br />
knees and the corveeture of my spine. Poumeerme! My heaviest <br />
crux and dairy lot it is, with a bed as hard as the thinkamuddles <br />
of the Greeks and a board as bare as a Roman altar. I’m off <br />
rabbited kitchens and relief porridgers. No later than a very few <br />
fortnichts since I was meeting on the Thinker’s Dam with a pair <br />
of men out of glasshouse whom I shuffled hands with named <br />
MacBlacks<span class="em">—</span>I think their names is MacBlakes<span class="em">—</span>from the Headfire <br />
Clump<span class="em">—</span>and they were improving me and making me beliek no <br />
five hour factory life with insufficient emollient and industrial <br />
disabled for them that day o’gratises. I have the highest grati- <br />
fication by anuncing how I have it from whowho but Hagios <br />
Colleenkiller’s prophecies. After suns and moons, dews and <br />
wettings, thunders and fires, comes sabotag. Solvitur palum- <br />
ballando! Tilvido! Adie!
<span class="em">—</span>Then, we explained, salve a tour, ambly andy, you possibly <br />
might be so by order?
<span class="em">—</span>Forgive me, Shaun repeated from his liquid lipes, not what <br />
I wants to do a strike of work but it was condemned on me pre- <br />
mitially by Hireark Books and Chiefoverseer Cooks in their <br />
