in life while possessing stout legs to be disbarred after holy orders <br />
from unnecessary servile work of reckless walking of all sorts for <br />
the relics of my time for otherwise by my so douching I would <br />
get into a blame there where sieves fall out, Excelsior tips the best. <br />
Weak stop work stop walk stop whoak. Go thou this island, one <br />
housesleep there, then go thou other island, two housesleep there, <br />
then catch one nightmaze, then home to dearies. Never back a <br />
woman you defend, never get quit of a friend on whom you <br />
depend never make face to a foe till he’s rife and never get stuck <br />
to another man’s pfife. Amen; ptah! His hungry will be done! On <br />
the continent as in Eironesia. But believe me in my simplicity I am <br />

the foe. Like the regular redshank I am. Impregnable as the mule <br />
himself. Somebody may perhaps hint at an aughter impression <br />
