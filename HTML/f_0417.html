<p class="ni">tant, penetrant, siphonopterous spuk. Grausssssss! Opr! <br />
Grausssssss! Opr!</p>

<p>The Gracehoper who, though blind as batflea, yet knew, not <br />
a leetle beetle, his good smetterling of entymology asped niss- <br />
unitimost lous nor liceens but promptly tossed himself in the <br />
vico, phthin and phthir, on top of his buzzer, tezzily wondering <br />
wheer would his aluck alight or boss of both appease and the <br />
next time he makes the aquinatance of the Ondt after this they <br />
have met themselves, these mouschical umsummables, it shall be <br />
motylucky if he will beheld not a world of differents. Behailed <br />
His Gross the Ondt, prostrandvorous upon his dhrone, in his <br />
Papylonian babooshkees, smolking a spatial brunt of Hosana <br />
cigals, with unshrinkables farfalling from his unthinkables, <br />
swarming of himself in his sunnyroom, sated before his com- <br />
fortumble phullupsuppy of a plate o’monkynous and a confucion <br />
of minthe (for he was a conformed aceticist and aristotaller), as <br />
appi as a oneysucker or a baskerboy on the Libido, with Floh <br />
biting his leg thigh and Luse lugging his luff leg and Bieni bussing <br />
him under his bonnet and Vespatilla blowing cosy fond tutties <br />
up the allabroad length of the large of his smalls. As entomate <br />
as intimate could pinchably be. Emmet and demmet and be jiltses <br />
crazed and be jadeses whipt! schneezed the Gracehoper, aguepe <br />
with ptchjelasys and at his wittol’s indts, what have eyeforsight!</p>

<p>The Ondt, that true and perfect host, a spiter aspinne, was <br />
making the greatest spass a body could with his queens lace- <br />
swinging for he was spizzing all over him like thingsumanything <br />
in formicolation, boundlessly blissfilled in an allallahbath of <br />
houris. He was ameising himself hugely at crabround and mary- <br />
pose, chasing Floh out of charity and tickling Luse, I hope too, <br />
and tackling Bienie, faith, as well, and jucking Vespatilla jukely <br />
by the chimiche. Never did Dorsan from Dunshanagan dance it <br />
with more devilry! The veripatetic imago of the impossible <br />
Gracehoper on his odderkop in the myre, after his thrice ephe- <br />
meral journeeys, sans mantis ne shooshooe, featherweighed <br />
animule, actually and presumptuably sinctifying chronic’s de- <br />
spair, was sufficiently and probably coocoo much for his chorous<span></span></p>
