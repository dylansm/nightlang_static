<p class="ni">of gravitates. Let him be Artalone the Weeps with his parisites <br />
peeling off him I’ll be Highfee the Crackasider. Flunkey Footle <br />
furloughed foul, writing off his phoney, but Conte Carme makes <br />
the melody that mints the money. Ad majorem l.s.d.! Divi gloriam. <br />
A darkener of the threshold. Haru? Orimis, capsizer of his ant- <br />
boat, sekketh rede from Evil-it-is, lord of loaves in Amongded. <br />
Be it! So be it! Thou-who-thou-art, the fleet-as-spindhrift, <br />
impfang thee of mine wideheight. Haru!</p>

<p>The thing pleased him andt, and andt, <br />
He larved ond he larved on he merd such a nauses <br />
The Gracehoper feared he would mixplace his fauces. <br />
I forgive you, grondt Ondt, said the Gracehoper, weeping, <br />
For their sukes of the sakes you are safe in whose keeping. <br />
Teach Floh and Luse polkas, show Bienie where’s sweet <br />
And be sure Vespatilla fines fat ones to heat. <br />
As I once played the piper I must now pay the count <br />
So saida to Moyhammlet and marhaba to your Mount! <br />
Let who likes lump above so what flies be a full ’un; <br />
I could not feel moregruggy if this was prompollen. <br />
I pick up your reproof, the horsegift of a friend, <br />
For the prize of your save is the price of my spend. <br />
Can castwhores pulladeftkiss if oldpollocks forsake ’em <br />
Or Culex feel etchy if Pulex don’t wake him? <br />
A locus to loue, a term it t’embarass, <br />
These twain are the twins that tick Homo Vulgaris. <br />
Has Aquileone nort winged to go syf <br />
Since the Gwyfyn we were in his farrest drewbryf <br />
And that Accident Man not beseeked where his story ends <br />
Since longsephyring sighs sought heartseast for their orience? <br />
We are Wastenot with Want, precondamned, two and true, <br />
Till Nolans go volants and Bruneyes come blue. <br />
Ere those gidflirts now gadding you quit your mocks for my gropes <br />
An extense must impull, an elapse must elopes, <br />
Of my tectucs takestock, tinktact, and ail’s weal; <br />
As I view by your farlook hale yourself to my heal.<span></span></p>
