Your whole’s whercabroads with Tout’s trightyright token on. <br />
My in risible universe youdly haud find <br />

Your feats end enormous, your volumes immense, <br />
(May the Graces I hoped for sing your Ondtship song sense!), <br />
Your genus its worldwide, your spacest sublime! <br />
But, Holy Saltmartin, why can’t you beat time?</p>

<p>In the name of the former and of the latter and of their holo- <br />
caust. Allmen.
<span class="em">—</span>Now? How good you are in explosition! How farflung is <br />
your fokloire and how velktingeling your volupkabulary! Qui <br />
vive sparanto qua muore contanto. O foibler, O flip, you’ve that <br />
wandervogl wail withyin! It falls easily upon the earopen and goes <br />
down the friskly shortiest like treacling tumtim with its tingting- <br />
taggle. The blarneyest blather in all Corneywall! But could you, <br />
of course, decent Lettrechaun, we knew (to change your name of <br />

the cinnamon quistoquill behind his acoustrolobe. I’m as after- <br />

play the sem backwards like Oscan wild or in shunt Persse trans- <br />
luding from the Otherman or off the Toptic or anything off the <br />
types of my finklers in the draught or with buttles, with my oyes <br />
thickshut and all. But, hellas, it is harrobrew bad on the corns and <br />
callouses. As far as that goes I associate myself with your remark <br />
just now from theodicy re’furloined notepaper and quite agree in <br />
your prescriptions for indeed I am, pay Gay, in juxtaposition to <br />
say it is not a nice production. It is a pinch of scribble, not <br />
wortha bottle of cabbis. Overdrawn! Puffedly offal tosh! Be- <br />

clerical horrors et omnibus` to be entered for the foreign as second- <br />
