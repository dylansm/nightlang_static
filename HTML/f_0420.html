on a single dimension what pronounced opinion I might possibly <br />
orally have about them bagses of trash which the mother and <br />
Mr Unmentionable (O breed not his same!) has reduced to writ- <br />
ing without making news out of my sootynemm. When she <br />
slipped under her couchman. And where he made a cat with a <br />
peep. How they wore two madges on the makewater. And why <br />
there were treefellers in the shrubrubs. Then he hawks his hand- <br />
mud figgers from Francie to Fritzie down in the kookin. Phiz <br />
is me mother and Hair’s me father. Bauv Betty Famm and Pig <br />
Pig Pike. Their livetree (may it flourish!) by their ecotaph (let it <br />
stayne!). With balsinbal bimbies swarming tiltop. Comme bien, <br />
Comme bien! Feefeel! Feefeel! And the Dutches dyin loffin at <br />
his pon peck de Barec. And all the mound reared. Till he wot not <br />

of a wet day would have more sabby.</p>
