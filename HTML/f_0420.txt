%ni%Flummery is what I would call it if you were to ask me to put it  
on a single dimension what pronounced opinion I might possibly  
orally have about them bagses of trash which the mother and  
Mr Unmentionable (O breed not his same!) has reduced to writ-  
ing without making news out of my sootynemm. When she  
slipped under her couchman. And where he made a cat with a  
peep. How they wore two madges on the makewater. And why  
there were treefellers in the shrubrubs. Then he hawks his hand-  
mud figgers from Francie to Fritzie down in the kookin. Phiz  
is me mother and Hair’s me father. Bauv Betty Famm and Pig  
Pig Pike. Their livetree (may it flourish!) by their ecotaph (let it  
stayne!). With balsinbal bimbies swarming tiltop. Comme bien,  
Comme bien! Feefeel! Feefeel! And the Dutches dyin loffin at  
his pon peck de Barec. And all the mound reared. Till he wot not  
wot to begin he should. An infant sailing eggshells on the floor  
of a wet day would have more sabby.
