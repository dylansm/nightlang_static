<p class="ni">jameymock farceson in Shemish like a mouther of the incas with <br />
a garcielasso huw Ananymus pinched her tights and about the <br />
Balt with the markshaire parawag and his loyal divorces, when he <br />
feraxiously shed ovas in Alemaney, tse tse, all the tell of the tud <br />
with the bourighevisien backclack, and him, the cribibber like an <br />
ambitrickster, aspiring like the decan’s, fast aslooped in the in- <br />
trance to his polthronechair with his sixth finger between his cats- <br />
eye and the index, making his pillgrimace of Childe Horrid, en- <br />
grossing to his ganderpan what the idioglossary he invented under <br />
hicks hyssop! Hock! Ickick gav him that toock, imitator! And it <br />
was entirely theck latter to blame. Does he drink because I am sorely <br />
there shall be no more Kates and Nells. If you see him it took <br />
place there. It was given meeck, thank the Bench, to assist at the <br />
whole thing byck special chancery licence. As often as I think of <br />
that unbloody housewarmer, Shem Skrivenitch, always cutting <br />
my prhose to please his phrase, bogorror, I declare I get the <br />
jawache! Be me punting his reflection he’d begin his beogre- <br />
fright in muddyass ribalds. Digteter! Grundtsagar! Swop beef! <br />
You know he’s peculiar, that eggschicker, with the smell of old <br />
woman off him, to suck nothing of his switchedupes. M.D. made <br />
his ante mortem for him. He was grey at three, like sygnus the <br />
swan, when he made his boo to the public and barnacled up to the <br />
eyes when he repented after seven. The alum that winters on his <br />
top is the stale of the staun that will soar when he stambles till <br />
that hag of the coombe rapes the pad off his lock. He was down <br />
with the whooping laugh at the age of the loss of reason the <br />
whopping first time he prediseased me. He’s weird, I tell you, and <br />
middayevil down to his vegetable soul. Never mind his falls <br />
feet and his tanbark complexion. That’s why he was forbidden <br />
tomate and was warmed off the ricecourse of marrimoney, under <br />
the Helpless Corpses Enactment. I’m not at all surprised the saint <br />
kicked him whereby the sum taken Berkeley showed the reason <br />
genrously. Negas, negasti<span class="em">—</span>negertop, negertoe, negertoby, ne- <br />
grunter! Then he was pusched out of Thingamuddy’s school <br />
by Miss Garterd, for itching. Then he caught the europicolas and <br />
went into the society of jewses. With Bro Cahlls and Fran Czeschs<span></span></p>
