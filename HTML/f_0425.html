yea. He store the tale of me shur. Like yup. How’s that for <br />
Shemese?
<span class="em">—</span>Still in a way, not to flatter you, we fancy you that you are <br />
so strikingly brainy and well letterread in yourshelves as ever were <br />
the Shamous Shamonous, Limited, could use worse of yourself, in- <br />
genious Shaun, we still so fancied, if only you would take your <br />
time so and the trouble of so doing it. Upu now!
<span class="em">—</span>Undoubtedly but that is show, Shaun replied, the mutter- <br />

could not, sole, so you can keep your space and by the power of <br />
blurry wards I am loyable to do it (I am convicted of it!) any time <br />
ever I liked (bet ye fippence off me boot allowance!) with the <br />

them all, tame, deep and harried, in my mine’s I. And one of <br />
these fine days, man dear, when the mood is on me, that I <br />
may willhap cut my throat with my tongue tonight but I will <br />
be ormuzd moved to take potlood and introvent it Paatryk just <br />

and a spaciaman spaciosum and a hundred and eleven other things, <br />
I would never for anything take so much trouble of such doing. <br />
And why so? Because I am altogether a chap too fly and hairyman <br />
