<p class="ni">slackfoot, linkman laizurely, lampman loungey, and by Killesther’s <br />
lapes and falls, with corks, staves and treeleaves and more bub- <br />
bles to his keelrow a fairish and easy way enough as the town cow <br />
cries behind the times in the direction of Mac Auliffe’s, the crucet- <br />
house, Open the Door Softly, down in the valley before he was <br />
really uprighted ere in a dip of the downs (uila!) he spoorlessly <br />
disappaled and vanesshed, like a popo down a papa, from circular <br />
circulatio. Ah, mean!</p>

<p>Gaogaogaone! Tapaa!</p>

<p>And the stellas were shinings. And the earthnight strewed <br />
aromatose. His pibrook creppt mong the donkness. A reek was <br />
waft on the luftstream. He was ours, all fragrance. And we were <br />
his for a lifetime. O dulcid dreamings languidous! Taboccoo!</p>

<p>It was sharming! But sharmeng!</p>

<p>And the lamp went out as it couldn’t glow on burning, yep, the <br />
lmp wnt out for it couldn’t stay alight.</p>

<p>Well, (how dire do we thee hours when thylike fades!) all’s dall <br />
and youllow and it is to bedowern that thou art passing hence, <br />
mine bruder, able Shaun, with a twhisking of the robe, ere the <br />
morning of light calms our hardest throes? beyond cods’ cradle <br />
and porpoise plain, from camal relations undfamiliar faces, to the <br />
inds of Tuskland where the oliphants scrum till the <br />
ousts of Amiracles where the toll stories grow proudest, more is <br />
the pity, but for all your deeds of goodness you were soo ooft and <br />
for ever doing, manomano and myriamilia even to mulimuli, as <br />
our humbler classes, whose virtue is humility, can tell, it is hardly <br />
we in the country of the old, Sean Moy, can part you for, oleypoe, <br />
you were the walking saint, you were, tootoo too stayer, the <br />
graced of gods and pittites and the salus of the wake. Countenance <br />
whose disparition afflictedly fond Fuinn feels. Winner of the <br />
gamings, primed at the studience, propredicted from the story- <br />
bouts, the choice of ages wise! Spickspookspokesman of our <br />
specturesque silentiousness! Musha, beminded of us out there in <br />
Cockpit, poor twelve o’clock scholars, sometime or other any- <br />
when you think the time. Wisha, becoming back to us way home <br />
in Biddyhouse one way or either anywhere we miss your smile.<span></span></p>
