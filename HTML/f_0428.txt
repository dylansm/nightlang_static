%ni%Palmwine breadfruit sweetmeat milksoup! Suasusupo! However!  
Our people here in Samoanesia will not be after forgetting you  
and the elders luking and marking the jornies, chalkin up drizzle  
in drizzle out on the four bare mats. How you would be thinking  
in your thoughts how the deepings did it all begin and how you  
would be scrimmaging through your scruples to collar a hold of  
an imperfection being committled. Sireland calls you. Mery Loye  
is saling moonlike. And Slyly mamourneen’s ladymaid at Glads-  
house Lodge. Turn your coat, strong character, and tarry among  
us down the vale, yougander, only once more! And may the mosse  
of prosperousness gather you rolling home! May foggy dews be-  
diamondise your hooprings! May the fireplug of filiality reinsure  
your bunghole! May the barleywind behind glow luck to your  
bathershins! ’Tis well we know you were loth to leave us,  
winding your hobbledehorn, right royal post, but, aruah sure,  
pulse of our slumber, dreambookpage, by the grace of Votre  
Dame, when the natural morning of your nocturne blankmerges  
into the national morning of golden sunup and Don Leary gets  
his own back from old grog Georges Quartos as that goodship the  
Jonnyjoys takes the wind from waterloogged Erin’s king, you  
will shiff across the Moylendsea and round up in your own  
escapology some canonisator’s day or other, sack on back, alack!  
digging snow, (not so?) like the good man you are, with your  
picture pockets turned knockside out in the rake of the rain for  
fresh remittances and from that till this in any case, timus tenant,  
may the tussocks grow quickly under your trampthickets and  
the daisies trip lightly over your battercops.
