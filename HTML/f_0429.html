<p class="episode" id="episode-14">Jaunty Jaun, as I was shortly before that made aware, next <br />
halted to fetch a breath, the first cothurminous leg of his night- <br />
stride being pulled through, and to loosen (let God’s son now be <br />
looking down on the poor preambler!) both of his bruised <br />
brogues that were plainly made a good bit before his hosen were, <br />
at the weir by Lazar’s Walk (for far and wide, as large as he was <br />
lively, was he noted for his humane treatment of any kind of <br />
abused footgear), a matter of maybe nine score or so barrelhours <br />
distance off as truly he merited to do. He was there, you could <br />
planemetrically see, when I took a closer look at him, that was to <br />
say, (gracious helpings, at this rate of growing our cotted child of <br />
yestereve will soon fill space and burst in systems, so speeds the <br />
instant!) amply altered for the brighter, though still the graven <br />
image of his squarer self as he was used to be, perspiring but <br />
happy notwithstanding his foot was still asleep on him, the way <br />
he thought, by the holy januarious, he had a bullock’s hoof in his <br />
buskin, with his halluxes so splendid, through Ireland untran- <br />
scended, bigmouthed poesther, propped up, restant, against a <br />
butterblond warden of the peace, one comestabulish Sigurdsen, <br />
(and where a better than such exsearfaceman to rest from roving <br />
the laddyown he bootblacked?) who, buried upright like the <br />
Osbornes, kozydozy, had tumbled slumbersomely on sleep at <br />
night duty behind the curing station, equilebriated amid the <br />
embracings of a monopolized bottle.</p>
