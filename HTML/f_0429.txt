{%Episode%}Jaunty Jaun, as I was shortly before that made aware, next  
halted to fetch a breath, the first cothurminous leg of his night-  
stride being pulled through, and to loosen (let God’s son now be  
looking down on the poor preambler!) both of his bruised  
brogues that were plainly made a good bit before his hosen were,  
at the weir by Lazar’s Walk (for far and wide, as large as he was  
lively, was he noted for his humane treatment of any kind of  
abused footgear), a matter of maybe nine score or so barrelhours  
distance off as truly he merited to do. He was there, you could  
planemetrically see, when I took a closer look at him, that was to  
say, (gracious helpings, at this rate of growing our cotted child of  
yestereve will soon fill space and burst in systems, so speeds the  
instant!) amply altered for the brighter, though still the graven  
image of his squarer self as he was used to be, perspiring but  
happy notwithstanding his foot was still asleep on him, the way  
he thought, by the holy januarious, he had a bullock’s hoof in his  
buskin, with his halluxes so splendid, through Ireland untran-  
scended, bigmouthed poesther, propped up, restant, against a  
butterblond warden of the peace, one comestabulish Sigurdsen,  
(and where a better than such exsearfaceman to rest from roving  
the laddyown he bootblacked?) who, buried upright like the  
Osbornes, kozydozy, had tumbled slumbersomely on sleep at  
night duty behind the curing station, equilebriated amid the  
embracings of a monopolized bottle.
