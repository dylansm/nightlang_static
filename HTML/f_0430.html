<p>Now, there were as many as twentynine hedge daughters out <br />
of Benent Saint Berched’s national nightschool (for they seemed <br />
to remember how it was still a once-upon-a-four year) learning <br />
their antemeridian lesson of life, under its tree, against its warn- <br />
ing, beseated, as they were, upon the brinkspondy, attracted to <br />
the rarerust sight of the first human yellowstone landmark (the <br />
bear, the boer, the king of all boors, sir Humphrey his knave <br />
we met on the moors!) while they paddled away, keeping time <br />
magnetically with their eight and fifty pedalettes, playing foolu- <br />
fool jouay allo misto posto, O so jaonickally, all barely in their <br />
typtap teens, describing a charming dactylogram of nocturnes <br />
though repelled by the snores of the log who looked stuck to <br />
the sod as ever and oft, when liquefied, (vil!) he murmoaned <br />
abasourdly in his Dutchener’s native, visibly unmoved, over his <br />
treasure trove for the crown: Dotter dead bedstead mean diggy <br />
smuggy flasky!</p>

<p>Jaun (after he had in the first place doffed a hat with a rein- <br />
forced crown and bowed to all the others in that chorus of praise <br />
of goodwill girls on their best beehiviour who all they were girls <br />
all rushing sowarmly for the post as buzzy as sie could bie to read <br />
his kisshands, kittering all about, rushing and making a tremen- <br />
dous girlsfuss over him pellmale, their jeune premier and his rosy- <br />
posy smile, mussing his frizzy hair and the golliwog curls of him, <br />
all, but that one; Finfria’s fairest, done in loveletters like a trayful <br />
of cloudberry tartlets (ain’t they fine, mighty, mighty fine and <br />
honoured?) and smilingly smelling, pair and pair about, broad <br />
by bread and slender to slimmer, the nice perfumios that came <br />
cunvy peeling off him (nice!) which was angelic simply, savouring <br />
of wild thyme and parsley jumbled with breadcrumbs (O nice!) <br />
and feeling his full fat pouch for him so tactily and jingaling <br />
his jellybags for, though he looked a young chapplie of sixtine, <br />
they could frole by his manhood that he was just the killingest <br />
ladykiller all by kindness, now you, Jaun, asking kindlily (hillo, <br />
missies!) after their howareyous at all with those of their dolly- <br />
begs (and where’s Agatha’s lamb? and how are Bernadetta’s <br />
columbillas? and Juliennaw’s tubberbunnies? and Eulalina’s<span></span></p>
