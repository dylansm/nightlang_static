<p class="ni">mon for ignitious Purpalume to the proper of Francisco Ultramare, <br />
last of scorchers, third of snows, in terrorgammons howdydos. <br />
Here she’s, is a bell, that’s wares in heaven, virginwhite, Undetri- <br />
gesima, vikissy manonna. Doremon’s! The same or similar to be <br />
kindly observed within the affianced dietcess of Gay O’Toole <br />
and Gloamy Gwenn du Lake (Danish spoken!) from Manducare <br />
Monday up till farrier’s siesta in china dominos. Words taken in <br />
triumph, my sweet assistance, from the sufferant pen of our joco- <br />
sus inkerman militant of the reed behind the ear.</p>

<p>Never miss your lostsomewhere mass for the couple in Myles <br />
you butrose to brideworship. Never hate mere pork which is bad <br />
for your knife of a good friday. Never let a hog of the howth <br />
trample underfoot your linen of Killiney. Never play lady’s game <br />
for the Lord’s stake. Never lose your heart away till you win his <br />
diamond back. Make a strong point of never kicking up your <br />
rumpus over the scroll end of sofas in the Dar Bey Coll Cafeteria <br />
by tootling risky apropos songs at commercial travellers’ smokers <br />
for their Columbian nights entertainments the like of White limbs <br />
they never stop teasing or Minxy was a Manxmaid when Murry <br />
wor a Man. And, by the bun, is it you goes bisbuiting His Esaus <br />
and Cos and then throws them bag in the box? Why the tin’s <br />
nearly empty. First thou shalt not smile. Twice thou shalt not <br />
love. Lust, thou shalt not commix idolatry. Hip confiners help <br />
compunction. Never park your brief stays in the men’s con- <br />
venience. Never clean your buttoncups with your dirty pair of <br />
sassers. Never ask his first person where’s your quickest cut to <br />
our last place. Never let the promising hand usemake free of <br />
your oncemaid sacral. The soft side of the axe! A coil of cord, a <br />
colleen coy, a blush on a bush turned first man’s laughter into <br />
wailful moither. O foolish cuppled! Ah, dice’s error! Never dip <br />
in the ern while you’ve browsers on your suite. Never slip the <br />
silver key through your gate of golden age. Collide with man, <br />
collude with money. Ere you sail foreget my prize. Where you <br />
truss be circumspicious and look before you leak, dears. Never <br />
christen medlard apples till a swithin is in sight. Wet your thistle <br />
where a weed is and you’ll rue it, despyneedis. Especially beware<span></span></p>
