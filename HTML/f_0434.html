<p class="ni">please of being at a party to any demoralizing home life. That <br />
saps a chap. Keep cool faith in the firm, have warm hoep in the <br />
house and begin frem athome to be chary of charity. Where it <br />
is nobler in the main to supper than the boys and errors of out- <br />
rager’s virtue. Give back those stolen kisses; restaure those all- <br />
cotten glooves. Recollect the yella perals that all too often beset <br />
green gerils, Rhidarhoda and Daradora, once they gethobby- <br />
horsical, playing breeches parts for Bessy Sudlow in flesh- <br />
coloured pantos instead of earthing down in the coalhole trying <br />
to boil the big gun’s dinner. Leg-before-Wicked lags-behind- <br />
Wall where here Mr Whicker whacked a great fall. Femora- <br />
familla feeled it a candleliked but Hayes, Conyngham and Erobin- <br />
son sware it’s an egg. Forglim mick aye! Stay, forestand and <br />
tillgive it! Remember the biter’s bitters I shed the vigil I buried <br />
our Harlotte Quai from poor Mrs Mangain’s of Britain Court on <br />
the feast of Marie Maudlin. Ah, who would wipe her weeper dry <br />
and lead her to the halter? Sold in her heyday, laid in the straw, <br />
bought for one puny petunia. Moral: if you can’t point a lily get <br />
to henna out of here! Put your swell foot foremost on foulardy <br />
pneumonia shertwaists, irriconcilible with true fiminin risirvi- <br />
tion and ribbons of lace, limenick’s disgrace. Sure, what is it on the <br />
whole only holes tied together, the merest and transparent washing- <br />
tones to make Languid Lola’s lingery longer? Scenta Clauthes <br />
stiffstuffs your hose and heartsies full of temptiness. Vanity flee <br />
and Verity fear! Diobell! Whalebones and buskbutts may hurt <br />
you (thwackaway thwuck!) but never lay bare your breast sec- <br />
ret (dickette’s place!) to joy a Jonas in the Dolphin’s Barncar <br />
with your meetual fan, Doveyed Covetfilles, comepulsing payn- <br />
attention spasms between the averthisment for Ulikah’s wine and <br />
a pair of pulldoors of the old cupiosity shape. There you’ll fix <br />
your eyes darkled on the autocart of the bringfast cable but here <br />
till youre martimorphysed please sit still face to face. For if the <br />
shorth of your skorth falls down to his knees pray how wrong <br />
will he look till he rises? Not before Gravesend is commuted. But <br />
now reappears Autist Algy, the pulcherman and would-do per- <br />
former, oleas Mr Smuth, stated by the vice crusaders to be well<span></span></p>
