<p class="ni">known to all the dallytaunties in and near the ciudad of Buellas <br />
Arias, taking you to the playguehouse to see the Smirching of <br />
Venus and asking with whispered offers in a very low bearded <br />
voice, with a nice little tiny manner and in a very nice little tony <br />
way, won’t you be an artist’s moral and pose in your nudies as a <br />
local esthetic before voluble old masters, introducing you, left <br />
to right the party comprises, to hogarths like Bottisilly and <br />
Titteretto and Vergognese and Coraggio with their extrahand <br />
Mazzaccio, plus the usual bilker’s dozen of dowdycameramen. <br />
And the volses of lewd Buylan, for innocence! And the phylli- <br />
sophies of Bussup Bulkeley. O, the frecklessness of the giddies <br />
nouveautays! There’s many’s the icepolled globetopper is haunt- <br />
ed by the hottest spot under his equator like Ramrod, the meaty <br />
hunter, always jaeger for a thrust. The back beautiful, the un- <br />
draped divine! And Suzy’s Moedl’s with their Blue Danuboyes! <br />
All blah! Viper’s vapid vilest! Put off the old man at the very <br />
font and get right on with the nutty sparker round the back. <br />
Slip your oval out of touch and let the paravis be your goal. <br />
Up leather, Prunella, convert your try! Stick wicks in your ear- <br />
shells when you hear the prompter’s voice. Look on a boa in <br />
his beauty and you’ll never more wear your strawberry leaves. <br />
Rely on the relic. What bondman ever you bind on earth I’ll be <br />
bound ’twas combined in hemel. Keep airly hores and the worm <br />
is yores. Dress the pussy for her nighty and follow her piggy- <br />
tails up their way to Winkyland. See little poupeep she’s firsht <br />
ashleep. After having sat your poetries and you know what <br />
happens when chine throws over jupan. Go to doss with <br />
the poulterer, you understand, and shake up with the milch- <br />
mand. The Sully van vultures are on the prowl. And the <br />
hailies fingringmaries. Tobaccos tabu and toboggan’s a back <br />
seat. Secret satieties and onanymous letters make the great un- <br />
watched as bad as their betters. Don’t on any account acquire <br />
a paunchon for that alltoocommon fagbutt habit of frequenting <br />
and chumming together with the braces of couples in Mr Tun- <br />
nelly’s hallways (smash it) wriggling with lowcusses and cock- <br />
chafers and vamps and rodants, with the end to commit acts of<span></span></p>
