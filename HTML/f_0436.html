<p class="ni">interstipital indecency as between twineties and tapegarters. <br />
fingerpats on fondlepets, under the couvrefeu act. It’s the thin <br />
end; wedge your steps! Your high powered hefty hoyden thinks <br />
nothing of ramping through a whole suite of smokeless hus- <br />
bands. Three minutes I’m counting you. Woooooon. No triching <br />
now! Give me that when I tell you! Ragazza ladra.! And is that <br />
any place to be smuggling his madam’s apples up? Deceitful <br />
jade. Gee wedge! Begor, I like the way they’re half cooked. <br />
Hold, flay, grill, fire that laney feeling for kosenkissing disgeni- <br />
cally within the proscribed limits like Population Peg on a hint or <br />
twim clandestinely does be doing to Temptation Tom, atkings <br />
questions in barely and snakking svarewords like a nursemagd. <br />
While there’s men-a’war on the say there’ll be loves-o’women <br />
on the do. Love through the usual channels, cisternbrothelly, <br />
when properly disinfected and taken neat in the generable way <br />
upon retiring to roost in the company of a husband-in-law or <br />
other respectable relative of an apposite sex, not love that leads <br />
by the nose as I foresmellt but canalised love, you understand, <br />
does a felon good, suspiciously if he has a slugger’s liver but I <br />
cannot belabour the point too ardently (and after the lessions of <br />
experience I speak from inspiration) that fetid spirits is the thief <br />
of prurities, so none of your twenty rod cherrywhisks, me <br />
daughter! At the Cat and Coney or the Spotted Dog. And at <br />
2bis Lot’s Road. When parties get tight for each other they lose <br />
all respect together. By the stench of her fizzle and the glib of her <br />
gab know the drunken draggletail Dublin drab. You’ll pay for <br />
each bally sorraday night every billing sumday morning. When <br />
the night is in May and the moon shines might. We won’t meeth <br />
in Navan till you try to give the Kellsfrieclub the goby. Hill or <br />
hollow, Hull or Hague! And beware how you dare of wet cock- <br />
tails in Kildare or the same may see your wedding driving home <br />
from your wake. Mades of ashens when you flirt spoil the lad <br />
but spare his shirt! Lay your lilylike long his shoulder but buck <br />
back if he buts bolder and just hep your homely hop and heed <br />
no horning but if you’ve got some brainy notion to raise cancan <br />
and rouse commotion I’ll be apt to flail that tail for you till it’s<span></span></p>
