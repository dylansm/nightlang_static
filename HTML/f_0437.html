<p class="ni">borning. Let the love ladleliked at the eye girde your gastricks <br />
in the gym. Nor must you omit to screw the lid firmly on that <br />
jazz jiggery and kick starts. Bumping races on the flat and point <br />
to point over obstacles. Ridewheeling that acclivisciously up <br />
windy Rutland Rise and insighting rebellious northers before the <br />
saunter of the city of Dunlob. Then breretonbiking on the free <br />
with your airs of go-be-dee and your heels upon the handlebars. <br />
Berrboel brazenness! No, before your corselage rib is decartilaged, <br />
that is to mean if you have visceral ptossis, my point is, making <br />
allowances for the fads of your weak abdominal wall and your <br />
liver asprewl, vinvin, vinvin, or should you feel, in shorts, as <br />
though you needed healthy physicking exorcise to flush your <br />
kidneys, you understand, and move that twelffinger bowel and <br />
threadworm inhibitating it, lassy, and perspire freely, lict your <br />
lector in the lobby and why out you go by the ostiary on to <br />
the dirt track and skip! Be a sportive. Deal with Nature the great <br />
greengrocer and pay regularly the monthlies. Your Punt’s Per- <br />
fume’s only in the hatpinny shop beside the reek of the rawny. <br />
It’s more important than air<span class="em">—</span>I mean than eats<span class="em">—</span>air (Oop, I <br />
never open momouth but I pack mefood in it) and promotes that <br />
natural emotion. Stamp out bad eggs. Why so many puddings <br />
prove disappointing, as Dietician says, in Creature Comforts <br />
Causeries, and why so much soup is so muck slop. If we <br />
could fatten on the elizabeetons we wouldn’t have teeth like <br />
the hippopotamians. However. Likewise if I were in your <br />
envelope shirt I’d keep my weathereye well cocked open for <br />
your furnished lodgers paying for their feed on tally with <br />
company and piano tunes. Only stuprifying yourself! The too <br />
friendly friend sort, Mazourikawitch or some other sukinsin of <br />
a vitch, who he’s kommen from olt Pannonia on this porpoise <br />
whom sue stooderin about the maul and femurl artickles and who <br />
mix himself so at home mid the musik and spanks the ivory <br />
that lovely for this your Mistro Melosiosus MacShine MacShane <br />
may soon prove your undoing and bane through the succeeding <br />
years of rain should you, whilst Jaun is from home, get used to <br />
basking in his loverslowlap, inordinately clad, moustacheteasing,<span></span></p>
