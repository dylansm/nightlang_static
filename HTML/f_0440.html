<p class="ni">pressdom. Apply your five wits to the four verilatest. The Arsdi- <br />
ken’s An Traitey on Miracula or Viewed to Death by a Priest <br />
Hunter is still first in the field despite the castle bar, William <br />
Archer’s a rompan good cathalogue and he’ll give you a riser on <br />
the route to our nazional labronry. Skim over Through Hell <br />
with the Papes (mostly boys) by the divine comic Denti Alligator <br />
(exsponging your index) and find a quip in a quire arisus aream <br />
from bastardtitle to fatherjohnson. Swear aloud by pious fiction <br />
the like of Lentil Lore by Carnival Cullen or that Percy Wynns <br />
of our S. J. Finn’s or Pease in Plenty by the Curer of Wars, <br />
licensed and censered by our most picturesque prelates, Their <br />
Graces of Linzen and Petitbois, bishops of Hibernites, licet ut <br />
lebanus, for expansion on the promises, the two best sells on the <br />
market this luckiest year, set up by Gill the father, put out by Gill <br />
the son and circulating disimally at Gillydehooly’s Cost. Strike up <br />
a nodding acquaintance for our doctrine with the works of old <br />
Mrs Trot, senior, and Manoel Canter, junior, and Loper de Figas, <br />
nates maximum. I used to follow Mary Liddlelambe’s flitsy tales, <br />
espicially with the scentaminted sauce. Sifted science will do your <br />
arts good. Egg Laid by Former Cock and With Flageolettes in Send <br />
Fanciesland. Chiefly girls. Trip over sacramental tea into the long <br />
lives of our saints and saucerdotes, with vignettes, cut short into <br />
instructual primers by those in authority for the bittermint of your <br />
soughts. Forfet not the palsied. Light a match for poor old <br />
Contrabally and send some balmoil for the schizmatics. A hemd <br />
in need is aye a friendly deed. Remember, maid, thou dust art <br />
powder but Cinderella thou must return (what are you robbing <br />
her sleeve for, Ruby? And pull in your tongue, Polly!). Cog that <br />
out of your teen times, everyone. The lad who brooks no <br />
breaches lifts the lass that toffs a tailor. How dare ye be laughing <br />
out of your mouthshine at the lack of that? Keep cool your fresh <br />
chastity which is far better far. Sooner than part with that vesta- <br />
lite emerald of the first importance, descended to me by far from <br />
our family, which you treasure up so closely where extremes <br />
meet, nay, mozzed lesmended, rather let the whole ekumene <br />
universe belong to merry Hal and do whatever his Mary well<span></span></p>
