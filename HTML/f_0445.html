<p class="ni">striped conference here’s how. Nerbu de Bios! If you twos goes <br />
to walk upon the railway, Gard, and I’ll goad to beat behind the <br />
bush! See to it! Snip! It’s up to you. I’ll be hatsnatching harrier <br />
to hiding huries hinder hedge. Snap! I’ll tear up your limpshades <br />
and lock all your trotters in the closet, I will, and cut your silk- <br />
skin into garters. You’ll give up your ask unbrodhel ways when <br />
I make you reely smart. So skelp your budd and kiss the hurt! <br />
I’ll have plenary sadisfaction, plays the bishop, for your partial’s <br />
indulgences if your my rodeo gell. Fair man and foul suggestion. <br />
There’s a lot of lecit pleasure coming bangslanging your way, <br />
Miss Pinpernelly satin. For your own good, you understand, for <br />
the man who lifts his pud to a woman is saving the way for <br />
kindness. You’ll rebmemer your mottob Aveh Tiger Roma <br />
mikely smarter the nickst time. For I’ll just draw my prancer <br />
and give you one splitpuck in the crupper, you understand, that <br />
will bring the poppy blush of shame to your peony hindmost till <br />
you yelp papapardon and radden your rhodatantarums to the <br />
beat of calorrubordolor, I am, I do and I suffer, (do you hear me <br />
now, lickspoon, and stop looking at your bussycat bow in the <br />
slate?) that you won’t obliterate for the bulkier part of a running <br />
year, failing to give a good account of yourself, if you think I’m <br />
so tan cupid as all that. Lights out now (bouf!), tight and sleep <br />
on it. And that’s how I’ll bottle your greedypuss beautibus for <br />
ye, me bullin heifer, for ’tis I that have the peer of arrams that <br />
carry a wallop. Between them.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to you would ire turn o’er see, a nuncio would <br />
I return here. How (from the sublime to the ridiculous) times <br />
out of oft, my future, shall we think with deepest of love and <br />
recollection by rintrospection of thee but me far away on the <br />
pillow, breathing foundly o’er my names all through the empties, <br />
whilst moidhered by the rattle of the doppeldoorknockers. Our <br />
homerole poet to Ostelinda, Fred Wetherly, puts it somewhys <br />
better. You’re sitting on me style, maybe, whereoft I helped <br />
your ore. Littlegame rumilie from Liffalidebankum, (Toobli- <br />
queme!) but a big corner fill you do in this unadulterated seat of <br />
our affections. Aerwenger’s my breed so may we uncreepingly<span></span></p>
