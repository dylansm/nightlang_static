and I bait you my chancey oldcoat against the whole ounce you <br />
half on your backboard (if madamaud strips mesdamines may <br />
cold strafe illglands!) that I’m the gogetter that’d make it pay like <br />
cash registers as sure as there’s a pot on a pole. And, what with one <br />
man’s fish and a dozen men’s poissons, sowing my wild plums to <br />
reap ripe plentihorns mead, lashings of erbole and hydromel and <br />

what it is, I’d never say let fly till we shot that blissup and <br />
swumped each other, manawife, into our sever nevers where I’d <br />

lechery, simpringly stitchless with admiracion, among the most <br />
uxuriously furnished compartments, with sybarate chambers, just <br />
