<p class="ni">luftsucks woabling around with the hedrolics in the coold amstop- <br />
here till the borting that would perish the Dane and his chapter <br />
of accidents to be atramental to the better half of my alltoolyrical <br />
health, not considering my capsflap, and that’s the truth now out <br />
of the cackling bag for truly sure, for another thing, I never could <br />
tell the leest falsehood that would truthfully give sotisfiction. I’m <br />
not talking apple sauce eithou. Or up in my hat. I earnst. Schue!</p>

<p>Sissibis dearest, as I was reading to myself not very long ago <br />
in Tennis Flonnels Mac Courther, his correspondance, besated <br />
upon my tripos, and just thinking like thauthor how long I’d like <br />
myself to be continued at Hothelizod, peeking into the focus and <br />
pecking at thumbnail reveries, pricking up ears to my phono on <br />
the ground and picking up airs from th’other over th’ether, ’tis <br />
tramsported with grief I am this night sublime, as you may see <br />
by my size and my brow that’s all forehead, to go forth, frank <br />
and hoppy, to the tune the old plow tied off, from our nostorey <br />
house, upon this benedictine errand but it is historically the most <br />
glorious mission, secret or profund, through all the annals of our <br />
<span class="em">—</span>as you so often term her<span class="em">—</span>efferfreshpainted livy, in beautific <br />
repose, upon the silence of the dead, from pharoph the nextfirst <br />
down to ramescheckles the last bust thing. The Vico road goes <br />
round and round to meet where terms begin. Still onappealed <br />
to by the cycles and unappalled by the recoursers we feel all <br />
serene, never you fret, as regards our dutyful cask. Full of my <br />
breadth from pride I am (breezed be the healthy same!) for ’tis a <br />
grand thing (superb!) to be going to meet a king, not an every- <br />
night king, nenni, by gannies, but the overking of Hither-on- <br />
Thither Erin himself, pardee, I’m saying. Before there was patch <br />
at all on Ireland there lived a lord at Lucan. We only wish <br />
everyone was as sure of anything in this watery world as we are <br />
of everything in the newlywet fellow that’s bound to follow. I’ll <br />
lay you a guinea for a hayseed now. Tell mother that. And tell <br />
her tell her old one. ’Twill amuse her.</p>

<p>Well, to the figends of Annanmeses with the wholeabuelish <br />
business! For I declare to Jeshuam I’m beginning to get sunsick! <br />
I’m not half Norawain for nothing. The fine ice so temperate<span></span></p>
