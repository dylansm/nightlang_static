<p class="ni">of our, alas, those times are not so far off as you might wish to <br />
be congealed. So now, I’ll ask of you, let ye create no scenes in <br />
my poor primmafore’s wake. I don’t want yous to be billow- <br />
fighting you biddy moriarty duels, gobble gabble, over me till <br />
you spit stout, you understand, after soused mackerel, sniffling <br />
clambake to hering and impudent barney, braggart of blarney, <br />
nor you ugly lemoncholic gobs o’er the hobs in a sewing circle, <br />
stopping oddments in maids’ costumes at sweeping reductions, <br />
wearing out your ohs by sitting around your ahs, making areek- <br />
eransy round where I last put it, with the painters in too, <br />
curse luck, with your rags up, exciting your mucuses, turning <br />
breakfarts into lost soupirs and salon thay nor you flabbies on <br />
your groaning chairs over Bollivar’s troubles of a bluemoondag, <br />
steamin your damp ossicles, praying Holy Prohibition and Jaun <br />
Dyspeptist while Ole Clo goes through the wood with Shep <br />
togather, touting in the chesnut burrs for Goodboy Sommers <br />
and Mistral Blownowse hugs his kindlings when voiceyversy <br />
it’s my gala bene fit, robbing leaves out of my taletold book. <br />
May my tunc fester if ever I see such a miry lot of maggalenes! <br />
Once upon a drunk and a fairly good drunk it was and the rest <br />
of your blatherumskite! Just a plain shays by the fire for absent- <br />
er Sh the Po and I’ll make ye all as eastern hummingsphere of <br />
myself the moment that you name the way. Look in the slag <br />
scuttle and you’ll see me sailspread over the singing, and what <br />
do ye want trippings for when you’ve Paris inspire your hat? <br />
Sussumcordials all round, let ye alloyiss and ominies, while I <br />
stray and let ye not be getting grief out of it, though blighted <br />
troth be all bereft, on my poor headsake, even should we forfeit <br />
our life. Lo, improving ages wait ye! In the orchard of the bones. <br />
Some time very presently now when yon clouds are dissipated <br />
after their forty years shower, the odds are, we shall all be hooked <br />
and happy, communionistically, among the fieldnights eliceam, <br />
élite of the elect, in the land of lost of time. Johannisburg’s a re- <br />
velation! Deck the diamants that never die! So cut out the lone- <br />
some stuff! Drink it up, ladies, please, as smart as you can lower <br />
it! Out with lent! Clap hands postilium! Fastintide is by. Your<span></span></p>
