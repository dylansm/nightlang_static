<p class="ni">hurricanes in our Cohortyard, no cupahurling nor apuckalips <br />
nor no puncheon jodelling nor no nothing. With the Byrns <br />
which is far better and eve for ever your idle be. You will hardly <br />
reconnoitre the old wife in the new bustle and the farmer shinner <br />
in his latterday paint. It’s the fulldress Toussaint’s wakeswalks <br />
experdition after a bail motion from the chamber of horrus. <br />
Saffron buns or sovran bonhams whichever you’r avider to like <br />
it and lump it, but give it a name. Iereny allover irelands. And <br />
there’s food for refection when the whole flock’s at home. Hog- <br />

di’yesmellyspatterygut? You take Joe Hanny’s tip for it! Post- <br />

grim life, till one finel howdiedow Bouncer Naster raps on the <br />
bell with a bone and his stinkers stank behind him with the <br />

Mark Time’s Finist Joke. Putting Allspace in a Notshall.</p>

<p>Well, the slice and veg joint’s well in its way, and so is a <br />
ribroast and jackknife as sporten dish, but home cooking every- <br />
time. Mountains good mustard and, with the helpings of ladies’ <br />
lickfings and gentlemen’s relish, I’ve eaten a griddle. But I fill <br />
twice as stewhard what I felt before when I’m after eating a few <br />
natives. The crisp of the crackling is in the chawing. Give us an- <br />
