the two Saint Collopys, blackmail him I will in arrears or my <br />
name’s not penitent Ferdinand! And it’s daily and hourly I’ll <br />
nurse him till he pays me fine fee. Ameal.</p>

<p>Well, here’s looking at ye! If I never leave you biddies till <br />
my stave is a bar I’d be tempted rigidly to become a passionate <br />
father. Me hunger’s weighed. Hungkung! Me anger’s suaged! <br />
Hangkang! Ye can stop as ye are, little lay mothers, and wait in <br />
wish and wish in vain till the grame reaper draws nigh, with <br />
the sickle of the sickles, as a blessing in disguise. Devil a curly <br />

in silkettes lining longroutes fo His Diligence Majesty, our <br />
longdistance laird that likes creation. To whoosh!
