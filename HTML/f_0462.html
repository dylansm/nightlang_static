<p class="ni">eucherised to yous. Also sacré père and maître d’autel. Well, <br />
ladies upon gentlermen and toastmaster general, let us, brindising <br />
brandisong, woo and win womenlong with health to rich vine- <br />
yards, Erin go Dry! Amingst the living waters of, the living in <br />
giving waters of. Tight! Loose! A stiff one for Staffetta mullified <br />
with creams of hourmony, the coupe that’s chill for jackless jill and <br />
a filiform dhouche on Doris! Esterelles, be not on your weeping <br />
what though Shaunathaun is in his fail! To stir up love’s young <br />
fizz I tilt with this bridle’s cup champagne, dimming douce from <br />
her peepair of hideseeks, tightsqueezed on my snowybrusted and <br />
while my pearlies in their sparkling wisdom are nippling her <br />
bubblets I swear (and let you swear!) by the bumper round of <br />
my poor old snaggletooth’s solidbowel I ne’er will prove I’m <br />
untrue to your liking (theare!) so long as my hole looks. Down.</p>

<p>So gullaby, me poor Isley! But I’m not for forgetting me <br />
innerman monophone for I’m leaving my darling proxy behind <br />
for your consolering, lost Dave the Dancekerl, a squamous run- <br />
away and a dear old man pal of mine too. He will arrive inces- <br />
santly in the fraction of a crust, who, could he quit doubling and <br />
stop tippling, he would be the unicorn of his kind. He’s the <br />
mightiest penumbrella I ever flourished on behond the shadow <br />
of a post! Be sure and link him, me O treasauro, as often as you <br />
learn provided there’s nothing between you but a plain deal <br />
table only don’t encourage him to cry lessontimes over Lepers- <br />
town. But soft! Can’t be? Do mailstanes mumble? Lumtum <br />
lumtum! Now! The froubadour! I fremble! Talk of wolf in a <br />
stomach by all that’s verminous! Eccolo me! The return of <br />
th’athlate! Who can secede to his success! Isn’t Jaunstown, <br />
Ousterrike, the small place after all? I knew I smelt the garlic <br />
leek! Why, bless me swits, here he its, darling Dave, like <br />
the catoninelives just in time as if he fell out of space, all <br />
draped in mufti, coming home to mourn mountains from his <br />
old continence and not on one foot either or on two feet <br />
aether but on quinquisecular cycles after his French evolution <br />
and a blindfold passage by the 4.32 with the pork’s pate in his <br />
suicide paw and the gulls laughing lime on his natural skunk,<span></span></p>
