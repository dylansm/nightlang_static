<p class="ni">blushing like Pat’s pig, begob! He’s not too timtom well ashamed <br />
to carry out onaglibtograbakelly in his showman’s sinister the <br />
testymonicals he gave his twenty annis orf, showing the three <br />
white feathers, as a home cured emigrant in Paddyouare far be- <br />
low on our sealevel. Bearer may leave the church, signed, Figura <br />
Porca, Lictor Magnaffica. He’s the sneaking likeness of us, faith, <br />
me altar’s ego in miniature and every Auxonian aimer’s ace as <br />
nasal a Romeo as I am, for ever cracking quips on himself, that <br />
merry, the jeenjakes, he’d soon arise mother’s roses mid bedew- <br />
ing tears under those wild wet lashes onto anny living girl’s <br />
laftercheeks. That’s his little veiniality. And his unpeppeppedi- <br />
ment. He has novel ideas I know and he’s a jarry queer fish be- <br />
times, I grant you, and cantanberous, the poisoner of his word, <br />
but lice and all and semicoloured stainedglasses, I’m enormously <br />
full of that foreigner, I’ll say I am! Got by the one goat, suckled <br />
by the same nanna, one twitch, one nature makes us oldworld <br />
kin. We’re as thick and thin now as two tubular jawballs. I hate <br />
him about his patent henesy, plasfh it, yet am I amorist. I love <br />
him. I love his old portugal’s nose. There’s the nasturtium for <br />
ye now that saved manny a poor sinker from water on the grave. <br />
The diasporation of all pirates and quinconcentrum of a fake like <br />
Basilius O’Cormacan MacArty? To camiflag he turned his shirt. <br />
Isn’t he after borrowing all before him, making friends with <br />
everybody red in Rossya, white in Alba and touching every dis- <br />
tinguished Ourishman he could ever distinguish before or be- <br />
hind from a Yourishman for the customary halp of a crown and <br />
peace? He is looking aged with his pebbled eyes, and johnnythin <br />
too, from livicking on pidgins’ ifs with puffins’ ands, he’s been <br />
slanderising himself, but I pass no remark. Hope he hasn’t the <br />
cholera. Give him an eyot in the farout. Moseses and Noasies, <br />
how are you? He’d be as snug as Columbsisle Jonas wrocked in <br />
the belly of the whaves, as quotad before. Bravo, senior chief! <br />
Famose! Sure there’s nobody else in touch anysides to hold a <br />
chef’s cankle to the darling at all for sheer dare with that prison- <br />
potstill of spanish breans on him like the knave of trifles! A jolly- <br />
tan fine demented brick and the prince of goodfilips! Dave<span></span></p>
