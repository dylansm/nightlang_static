<p class="ni">knows I have the highest of respect of annyone in my oweand <br />
smooth way for that intellectual debtor (Obbligado!) Mushure <br />
David R. Crozier. And we’re the closest of chems. Mark my use <br />
of you, cog! Take notice how I yemploy, crib! Be ware as you, <br />
I foil, coppy! It’s a pity he can’t see it for I’m terribly nice about <br />
him. Canwyll y Cymry, the marmade’s flamme! A leal of the <br />
O’Looniys, a Brazel aboo! The most omportent man! Shervos! <br />
Ho, be the holy snakes, someone has shaved his rough diamond <br />
skull for him as clean as Nuntius’ piedish! The burnt out <br />
mesh and the matting and all! Thunderweather, khyber schinker <br />
escapa sansa pagar! He’s the spatton spit, so he is, scaly skin <br />
and all, with his blackguarded eye and the goatsbeard in <br />
his buttinghole of Shemuel Tulliver, me grandsourd, the old <br />
cruxader, when he off with his paudeen! That was to let the <br />
crowd of the Flu Flux Fans behind him see me proper. Ah, <br />
he’s very thoughtful and sympatrico that way is Brother Intelli- <br />
gentius, when he’s not absintheminded, with his Paris addresse! <br />
He is, really. Holdhard till you’ll ear him clicking his bull’s <br />
bones! Some toad klakkin! You’re welcome back, Wilkins, to <br />
red berries in the frost! And here’s the butter exchange to pfeife <br />
and dramn ye with a bawlful of the Moulsaybaysse and yunker <br />
doodler wanked to wall awriting off his phoney. I’m tired hair- <br />
ing of you. Hat yourself! Give us your dyed dextremity here, <br />
frother, the Claddagh clasp! I met with dapper dandy and he <br />
shocked me big the hamd. Where’s your watch keeper? You’ve <br />
seen all sorts in shapes and sizes, marauding about the moppa- <br />
mound. How’s the cock and the bullfight? And old Auster and <br />
Hungrig? And the Beer and Belly and the Boot and Ball? Not <br />
forgetting the oils of greas under that turkey in julep and Father <br />
Freeshots Feilbogen in his rockery garden with the costard? And <br />
tid you meet with Peadhar the Grab at all? And did you call on <br />
Tower Geesyhus? Was Mona, my own love, no bigger than she <br />
should be, making up to you in her bestbehaved manor when <br />
you made your breastlaw and made her, tell me? And did you <br />
like the landskip from Lambay? I’m better pleased than ten <br />
guidneys! You rejoice me! Faith, I’m proud of you, french davit!<span></span></p>
