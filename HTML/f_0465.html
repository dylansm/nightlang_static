<p class="ni">You’ve surpassed yourself! Be introduced to yes! This is me aunt <br />
Julia Bride, your honour, dying to have you languish to scan- <br />
dal in her bosky old delltangle. You don’t reckoneyes him? He’s <br />
Jackot the Horner who boxed in his corner, jilting no fewer than <br />
three female bribes. That’s his penals. Shervorum! You haven’t <br />
seen her since she stepped into her drawoffs. Come on, spinister, <br />
do your stuff! Don’t be shoy, husbandmanvir! Weih, what’s on <br />
you, wip? Up the shamewaugh! She has plenty of woom in the <br />
smallclothes for the bothsforus, nephews push! Hatch yourself <br />
well! Enjombyourselves thurily! Would you wait biss she buds <br />
till you bite on her? Embrace her bashfully by almeans at my <br />
frank incensive and tell her in your semiological agglutinative yez, <br />
how Idos be asking after her. Let us be holy and evil and let her <br />
be peace on the bough. Sure, she fell in line with our tripertight <br />
photos as the lyonised mails when we were stablelads together <br />
like the corks again brothers, hungry and angry, cavileer <br />
grace by roundhered force, or like boyrun to sibster, me and <br />
you, shinners true and pinchme, our tertius quiddus, that never <br />
talked or listened. Always raving how we had the wrinkles of <br />
a snailcharmer and the slits and sniffers of a fellow that fell foul <br />
of the county de Loona and the meattrap of the first vegetarian. <br />
To be had for the asking. Have a hug! Take her out of poor <br />
tuppeny luck before she goes off in pure treple licquidance. I’d <br />
give three shillings a pullet to the canon for the conjugation to <br />
shadow you kissing her from me leberally all over as if she was a <br />
crucifix. It’s good for her bilabials, you understand. There’s no- <br />
thing like the mistletouch for finding a queen’s earring false. <br />
Chink chink. As the curly bard said after kitchin the womn in <br />
his hym to the hum of her garments. You try a little tich to the <br />
tissle of his tail. The racist to the racy, rossy. The soil is for the <br />
self alone. Be ownkind. Be kithkinish. Be bloodysibby. Be irish. <br />
Be inish. Be offalia. Be hamlet. Be the property plot. Be Yorick; <br />
and Lankystare. Be cool. Be mackinamucks of yourselves. Be <br />
finish. No martyr where the preature is there’s no plagues like <br />
rome. It gives up the gripes. Watch the swansway. Take your <br />
tiger over it. The leady on the lake and the convict of the forest.<span></span></p>
