<p class="ni">bark is still there but the molars are gone. The misery billyboots <br />
I used to lend him before we split and, be the hole in the year, <br />
they were laking like heaven’s reflexes. But I told him make your <br />
will be done and go to a general and I’d pray confessions for <br />
him. Areesh! Areesh! And I’ll be your intrepider. Ambras! <br />
Ruffle her! Bussing was before the blood and bissing will behind <br />
the curtain. Triss! Did you note that worrid expressionism on <br />
his megalogue? A full octavium below me! And did you hear <br />
his browrings rattlemaking when he was preaching to himself? <br />
And, whoa! do you twig the schamlooking leaf greeping ghastly <br />
down his blousyfrock? Our national umbloom! Areesh! He <br />
won’t. He’s shoy. Those worthies, my old faher’s onkel that <br />
was garotted, Caius Cocoa Codinhand, that I lost in a crowd, <br />
used to chop that tongue of his, japlatin, with my yuonkle’s <br />
owlseller, Woowoolfe Woodenbeard, that went stomebathred, <br />
in the Tower of Balbus, as brisk, man, as I’d scoff up muttan <br />
chepps and lobscouse. But it’s all deafman’s duff to me, <br />
begob. Sam knows miles bettern me how to work the <br />
miracle. And I see by his diarrhio he’s dropping the stammer <br />
out of his silenced bladder since I bonded him off more as a <br />
friend and as a brother to try and grow a muff and canonise his <br />
dead feet down on the river airy by thinking himself into the <br />
fourth dimension and place the ocean between his and ours, <br />
the churchyard in the cloister of the depths, after he was capped <br />
out of beurlads scoel for the sin against the past participle and <br />
earned the factitation of codding chaplan and being as homely <br />
gauche as swift B.A.A. Who gets twickly fullgets twice as alle- <br />
manden huskers. But the whacker his word the weaker our ears <br />
for auracles who parles parses orileys. Illstarred punster, lipster- <br />
ing cowknucks. ’Twas the quadra sent him and Trinity too. And <br />
he can cantab as chipper as any oxon ever I mood with, a tiptoe <br />
singer! He’ll prisckly soon hand tune -your Erin’s ear for you. <br />
p.p. a mimograph at a time, numan bitter, with his ancomartins <br />
to read the road roman with false steps ad Pernicious from <br />
rhearsilvar ormolus to torquinions superbers while I’m far <br />
away from wherever thou art serving my tallyhos and tullying<span></span></p>
