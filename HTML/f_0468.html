<p class="ni">my hostilious by going in by the most holy recitatandas üüüü for <br />
my varsatile examinations in the ologies, to be a coach on the <br />
Fukien mission. P? F? How used you learn me, brather <br />
soboostius, in my augustan days? With cesarella looking on. <br />
In the beginning was the gest he jousstly says, for the end is <br />
with woman, flesh-without-word, while the man to be is in a <br />
worse case after than before since she on the supine satisfies <br />
the verg to him! Toughtough, tootoological. Thou the first <br />
person shingeller. Art, an imperfect subjunctive. Paltry, <br />
flappent, had serious. Miss Smith onamatterpoetic. Hammis- <br />
andivis axes colles waxes warmas like sodullas. So pick your <br />
stops with fondnes snow. And mind you twine the twos <br />
noods of your nicenames. And pull up your furbelovs as far- <br />
above as you’re farthingales. That’ll hint him how to click the <br />
trigger. Show you shall and won’t he will! His hearing is in- <br />
doubting just as my seeing is onbelieving. So dactylise him up <br />
to blankpoint and let him blink for himself where you speak the <br />
best ticklish. You’ll feel what I mean. Fond namer, let me never <br />
see thee blame a kiss for shame a knee!</p>

<p>Echo, read ending! Siparioramoci! But from the stress of <br />
their sunder enlivening, ay clasp, deciduously, a nikrokosmikon <br />
must come to mike.
<span class="em">—</span>Well, my positively last at any stage! I hate to look at alarms <br />
but, however they put on my watchcraft, must now close as I <br />
hereby hear by ear from by seeless socks ’tis time to be up and <br />
ambling. Mymiddle toe’s mitching, so mizzle I must else ’twill <br />
sarve me out. Gulp a bulper at parting and the moore the <br />
melodest! Farewell but whenever, as Tisdall told Toole. <br />
Tempos fidgets. Let flee me fiacckles, says the grand old mano- <br />
ark, stormcrested crowcock and undulant hair, hoodies tway! <br />
Yes, faith, I am as mew let freer, beneath me corthage, bound. <br />
I’m as bored now bawling beersgrace at sorepaws there as Andrew <br />
Clays was sharing sawdust with Daniel’s old collie. This shack’s <br />
not big enough for me now. I’m dreaming of ye, azores. And, re- <br />
member this, a chorines, there’s the witch on the heath, sistra! <br />
