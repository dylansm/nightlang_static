<p class="ni">ho. And whinn muinnuit flittsbit twinn her ttittshe cries <br />
tallmidy! Daughters of the heavens, be lucks in turnabouts <br />
to the wandering sons of red loam! The earth’s atrot! The <br />
sun’s a scream! The air’s a jig. The water’s great! Seven oldy <br />
oldy hills and the one blue beamer. I’m going. I know I am. <br />
I could bet I am. Somewhere I must get far away from Banba- <br />
shore, wherever I am. No saddle, no staffet, but spur on the <br />
moment! So I think I’ll take freeboots’ advise. Psk! I’ll borrow <br />
a path to lend me wings, quickquack, and from Jehusalem’s <br />
wall, clickclack, me courser’s clear, to Cheerup street I’ll travel <br />
the void world over. It’s Winland for moyne, bickbuck! Jee- <br />
jakers! I hurt meself nettly that time! Come, my good frog- <br />
marchers! We felt the fall but we’ll front the defile. Was not my <br />
olty mutther, Sereth Maritza, a Runningwater? And the bould <br />
one that quickened her the seaborne Fingale? I feel like that <br />
hill of a whaler went yulding round Groenmund’s Circus with <br />
his tree full of seaweeds and Dinky Doll asleep in her shell. <br />
Hazelridge has seen me. Jerne valing is. Squall aboard for Kew, <br />
hop! Farewell awhile to her and thee! The brine’s my bride to <br />
be. Lead on, Macadam, and danked be he who first sights Halt <br />
Linduff! Solo, solone, solong! Lood Erynnana, ware thee wail! <br />
With me singame soarem o’erem! Here’s me take off. Now’s <br />
nunc or nimmer, siskinder! Here goes the enemy! Bennydick <br />
hotfoots onimpudent stayers! Sorry! I bless alls to the whished <br />
with this panromain apological which Watllwewhistlem sang to <br />
the kerrycoys. Break ranks! After wage-of-battle bother I am <br />
thinking most. Fik yew! I’m through. Won. Toe. Adry. You <br />
watch my smoke.</p>

<p>After poor Jaun the Boast’s last fireless words of postludium <br />
of his soapbox speech ending in’sheaven, twentyaid add one with <br />
a flirt of wings were pouring to his bysistance (could they snip <br />
that curl of curls to lay with their gloves and keep the kids <br />
bright!) prepared to cheer him should he leap or to curse him <br />
should he fall, but, with their biga triga rheda rodeo, the cherubs <br />
in the charabang, set down here and sedan chair, don’t you <br />
wish you’d a yoke or a bit in your mouth, repulsing all attempts<span></span></p>
