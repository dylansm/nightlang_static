<p class="ni">at first hands on, as no es nada, our greatly misunderstood one <br />
we perceived to give himself some sort of a hermetic prod or <br />
kick to sit up and take notice, which acted like magic, while <br />
the phalanx of daughters of February Filldyke, embushed and <br />
climbing, ramblers and weeps, voiced approval in their customary <br />
manner by dropping kneedeep in tears over their concelebrated <br />
meednight sunflower, piopadey boy, their solase in dorckaness, <br />
and splattering together joyously the plaps of their tappyhands <br />
as, with a cry of genuine distress, so prettly prattly pollylogue, <br />
they viewed him, the just one, their darling, away.</p>

<p>A dream of favours, a favourable dream. They know how they <br />
believe that they believe that they know. Wherefore they wail.</p>

<p>Eh jourd’weh! Oh jourd’woe! dosiriously it psalmodied. Gues- <br />

among the weiners, (who by this were in half droopleaflong <br />
mourning for the passing of the last post) the familiar yellow <br />
label into which he let fall a drop, smothered a curse, choked a <br />
guffaw, spat expectoratiously and blew his own trumpet. And next <br />
thing was he gummalicked the stickyback side and stamped the <br />
oval badge of belief to his agnelows brow with a genuine <br />
dash of irrepressible piety that readily turned his ladylike <br />
typmanzelles capsy curvy (the holy scamp!), with half a <br />
glance of Irish frisky (a Juan Jaimesan hastaluego) from under <br />
the shag of his parallel brows. It was then he made as if be <br />
but waved instead a handacross the sea as notice to quit while <br />
the pacifettes made their armpacts widdershins (Frida! Freda!<span></span></p>
