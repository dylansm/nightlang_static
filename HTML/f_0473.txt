%ni%longsuffering and decennia of brief glory, to mind us of what  
was when and to matter us of the withering of our ways, their  
Janyouare Fibyouare wins true from Sylvester (only Walker  
himself is like Waltzer, whimsicalissimo they go murmurand)  
comes marching ahome on the summer-crust of the flagway.  
Life, it is true, will be a blank without you because avicuum’s not  
there at all, to nomore cares from nomad knows, ere Molochy  
wars bring the devil era, a slip of the time between a date and a  
ghostmark, rived by darby’s chilldays embers, spatched fun  
Juhn that dandyforth, from the night we are and feel and fade  
with to the yesterselves we tread to turnupon.

But, boy, you did your strong nine furlong mile in slick and  
slapstick record time and a farfetched deed it was in troth, cham-  
pion docile, with your high bouncing gait of going and your  
feat of passage will be contested with you and through you, for  
centuries to come. The phaynix rose a sun before Erebia sank his  
smother! Shoot up on that, bright Bennu bird! Va faotre!  
Eftsoon so too will our own sphoenix spark spirt his spyre  
and sunward stride the rampante flambe. Ay, already the  
sombrer opacities of the gloom are sphanished! Brave footsore  
Haun! Work your progress! Hold to! Now! Win out, ye divil ye!  
The silent cock shall crow at ]ast. The west shall shake the east  
awake. Walk while ye have the night for morn, lightbreakfast-  
bringer, morroweth whereon every past shall full fost sleep.  
Amain.
