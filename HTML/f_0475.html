<p class="ni">sweat of night blues moist upon them. Feefee! phopho!! <br />
foorchtha!!! aggala!!!! jeeshee!!!!! paloola!!!!!! ooridiminy!!!!!!! <br />
Afeared themselves were to wonder at the class of a crossroads <br />
puzzler he would likely be, length by breadth nonplussing his <br />
thickness, ells upon ells of him, making so many square yards of <br />
him, one half of him in Conn’s half but the whole of him never- <br />
theless in Owenmore’s five quarters. There would he lay till <br />
they would him descry, spancelled down upon a blossomy bed, at <br />
one foule stretch, amongst the daffydowndillies, the flowers of <br />
narcosis fourfettering his footlights, a halohedge of wild spuds <br />
hovering over him, epicures waltzing with gardenfillers, puritan <br />
shoots advancing to Aran chiefs. Phopho!! The meteor pulp <br />
of him, the seamless rainbowpeel. Aggala!!!! His bellyvoid of <br />
nebulose with his neverstop navel. Paloola!!!!!! And his veins <br />
shooting melanite phosphor, his creamtocustard cometshair and <br />
his asteroid knuckles, ribs and members. Ooridiminy!!!!!!! His <br />
electrolatiginous twisted entrails belt.</p>

<p>Those four claymen clomb together to hold their sworn star- <br />
chamber quiry on him. For he was ever their quarrel, the way <br />
they would see themselves, everybug his bodiment atop of <br />
annywom her notion, and the meet of their noght was worth two <br />
of his morning. Up to the esker ridge it was, Mallinger parish, to a <br />
mead that was not far, the son’s rest. First klettered Shanator <br />
Gregory, seeking spoor through the deep timefield, Shanator <br />
Lyons, trailing the wavy line of his partition footsteps (some- <br />
thing in his blisters was telling him all along how he had <br />
been in that place one time), then his Recordership, Dr Shuna- <br />
dure Tarpey, caperchasing after honourable sleep, hot on to the <br />
aniseed and, up out of his prompt corner, old Shunny MacShunny, <br />
MacDougal the hiker, in the rere of them on the run, to make a <br />
quorum. Roping their ass he was, their skygrey globetrotter, <br />
by way of an afterthought and by no means legless either for <br />
such sprouts on him they were that much oneven it was tumbling <br />
he was by four lengths, within the bawl of a mascot, kuss yuss, <br />
kuss cley, patsy watsy, like the kapr in the kabisses, the big ass, <br />
to hear with his unaided ears the harp in the air, the bugle<span></span></p>
