<p class="ni">dianablowing, wild as wild, the mockingbird whose word is <br />
misfortune, so ’tis said, the bulbul down the wind.</p>

<p>The proto was traipsing through the tangle then, Mathew <br />
Walker, godsons’ goddestfar, deputising for gossipocracy, <br />
and his station was a few perch to the weatherside of the <br />
knoll Asnoch and it was from no other place unless there, how <br />
and ever, that he proxtended aloof upon the ether Mesmer’s <br />
Manuum, the hand making silence. The buckos beyond on the lea, <br />
then stopped wheresoever they found their standings and that way <br />
they set ward about him, doing obedience, nod, bend, bow and <br />
curtsey, like the watchers of Prospect, upholding their broad- <br />
awake prober’s hats on their firrum heads, the travelling court on <br />
its findings circuiting that personer in his fallen. And a crack quat- <br />
youare of stenoggers they made of themselves, solons and psy- <br />
chomorers, all told, with their hurts and daimons, spites and <br />
clops, not even to the seclusion of their beast by them that was <br />
the odd trick of the pack, trump and no friend of carrots. And, <br />
what do you think, who should be laying there above all other <br />
persons forenenst them only Yawn! All of asprawl he was laying <br />
too amengst the poppies and, I can tell you something more than <br />
that, drear writer, profoundly as you may bedeave to it, he was <br />
oscasleep asleep. And it was far more similar to a satrap he lay there <br />
with unctuous beauty all surrounded, the poser, or for whatall I <br />
know like Lord Lumen, coaching his preferred constellations in <br />
faith and doctrine, for old Matt Gregory, ’tis he had the starmenag- <br />
erie, Marcus Lyons and Lucas Metcalfe Tarpey and the mack <br />
that never forgave the ass that lurked behind him, Jonny na <br />
Hossaleen.</p>

<p>More than their good share of their five senses ensorcelled <br />
you would say themselves were, fuming censor, the way they <br />
could not rightly tell their heels from their stools as they cooched <br />
down a mamalujo by his cubical crib, as question time drew <br />
nighing and the map of the souls’ groupography rose in relief <br />
within their quarterings, to play tops or kites or hoops or marbles, <br />
curchycurchy, gawking on him, for the issuance of his pnum and <br />
softnoising one of them to another one, the boguaqueesthers.<span></span></p>
