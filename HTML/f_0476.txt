misfortune, so ’tis said, the bulbul down the wind.

The proto was traipsing through the tangle then, Mathew  
Walker, godsons’ goddestfar, deputising for gossipocracy,  
and his station was a few perch to the weatherside of the  
knoll Asnoch and it was from no other place unless there, how  
and ever, that he proxtended aloof upon the ether Mesmer’s  
Manuum, the hand making silence. The buckos beyond on the lea,  
then stopped wheresoever they found their standings and that way  
they set ward about him, doing obedience, nod, bend, bow and  
curtsey, like the watchers of Prospect, upholding their broad-  
awake prober’s hats on their firrum heads, the travelling court on  
its findings circuiting that personer in his fallen. And a crack quat-  
youare of stenoggers they made of themselves, solons and psy-  
chomorers, all told, with their hurts and daimons, spites and  
clops, not even to the seclusion of their beast by them that was  
the odd trick of the pack, trump and no friend of carrots. And,  
what do you think, who should be laying there above all other

know like Lord Lumen, coaching his preferred constellations in  
faith and doctrine, for old Matt Gregory, ’tis he had the starmenag-  
erie, Marcus Lyons and Lucas Metcalfe Tarpey and the mack  
that never forgave the ass that lurked behind him, Jonny na  
Hossaleen.

More than their good share of their five senses ensorcelled  
you would say themselves were, fuming censor, the way they  
could not rightly tell their heels from their stools as they cooched  
down a mamalujo by his cubical crib, as question time drew  
nighing and the map of the souls’ groupography rose in relief  
within their quarterings, to play tops or kites or hoops or marbles,  
curchycurchy, gawking on him, for the issuance of his pnum and  
softnoising one of them to another one, the boguaqueesthers.%j%
