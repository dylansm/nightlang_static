masters, what way was he.
<span class="em">—</span>He’s giving, the wee bairn. Yun has lived.
<span class="em">—</span>Yerra, why dat, my leader?
<span class="em">—</span>Wisha, is he boosed or what, alannah?
<span class="em">—</span>Or his wind’s from the wrong cut, says Ned of the Hill.
<span class="em">—</span>Lesten!
<span class="em">—</span>Why so and speak up, do you hear me, you sir?
<span class="em">—</span>Or he’s rehearsing somewan’s funeral.
<span class="em">—</span>Whisht outathat! Hubba’s up!</p>

<p>And as they were spreading abroad on their octopuds their <br />
drifter nets, the chromous gleamy seiners’ nets and, no lie, there was <br />

the planckton at play about him, the quivers of scaly silver and <br />
their clutches of chromes of the highly lucid spanishing gold <br />
whilst, as hour gave way to mazing hour, with Yawn himself <br />
keeping time with his thripthongue, to ope his blurbeous lips he <br />
would, a let out classy, the way myrrh of the moor and molten <br />
moonmist would be melding mellifond indo his mouth.
<span class="em">—</span>Y?
<span class="em">—</span>Before You!
<span class="em">—</span>Ecko! How sweet thee answer makes! Afterwheres? In the <br />
land of lions’ odor?
<span class="em">—</span>Friends! First if yu don’t mind. Name yur historical grouns.
