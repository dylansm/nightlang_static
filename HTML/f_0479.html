<p class="ni">I used to be always overthere on the fourth day at my grand- <br />
mother’s place, Tear-nan-Ogre, my little grey home in the west, <br />
in or about Mayo when the long dog gave tongue and they <br />
coursing the marches and they straining at the leash. Tortoise- <br />
shell for a guineagould! Burb! Burb! Burb! Follow me up <br />
Tucurlugh! That’s the place for the claire oysters, Polldoody, <br />
County Conway. I never knew how rich I was like another story in <br />
the zoedone of the zephyros, strolling and strolling, carrying my <br />
dragoman, Meads Marvel, thass withumpronouceable tail, along <br />
the shore. Do you know my cousin, Mr Jasper Dougal that <br />
keeps the Anchor on the Mountain, the parson’s son, Jasper of <br />
the Tuns, Pat Whateveryournameis?
<span class="em">—</span>Dood and I dood. The wolves of Fochlut! By Whydoyou- <br />
callme? Do not flingamejig to the twolves!
<span class="em">—</span>Turcafiera amd that’s a good wan right enough! Wooluvs <br />
no less!
<span class="em">—</span>One moment now, if I foreshorten the bloss on your <br />
bleather. Encroachement spells erosion. Dunlin and turnstone <br />
augur us where, how and when best as to burial of carcass, fuse- <br />
lage of dump and committal of noisance. But, since you invocate <br />
austers for the trailing of vixens, I would like to send a cormo- <br />
rant around this blue lagoon. Tell me now this. You told my <br />
larned friend rather previously, a moment since, about this mound <br />
or barrow. Now I suggest to you that ere there was this plague- <br />
burrow, as you seem to call it, there was a burialbattell, the boat <br />
of millions of years. Would you bear me out in that, relatively <br />
speaking, with her jackstaff jerking at her pennyladders, why <br />
not, and sizing a fair sail, knowest thout the kind? The Pourquoi <br />
Pas, bound for Weissduwasland, that fourmaster barquentine, <br />
Webster says, our ship that ne’re returned. The Frenchman, I say, <br />
was an orangeboat. He is a boat. You see him. The both how <br />
you see is they! Draken af Danemork! Sacked it or ate it? What! <br />
Hennu! Spake ab laut!
<span class="em">—</span>Couch, cortege, ringbarrow, dungcairn. Beseek the runes <br />
and see the longurn! Allmaun away when you hear the gang- <br />
horn. And meet Nautsen. Ess Ess. O ess. Warum night! Con-<span></span></p>
