<p class="ni">your iberborealic imagination, when it’s quicker than this quack- <br />
ing that you might, bar accidens, be very largely substituted in <br />
potential secession from your next life by a complementary char- <br />
acter, voices apart? Upjack! I shudder for your thought! Think! <br />
Put from your mind that and take on trust this. The next word <br />
depends on your answer.
<span class="em">—</span>I’m thinking to, thogged be thenked! I was just trying to <br />
think when I thought I felt a flea. I might have. I cannot say for <br />
it is of no significance at all. Once or twice when I was in odin- <br />
burgh with my addlefoes, Jake Jones, the handscabby, when I <br />
thinkled I wore trying on my garden substisuit, boy’s apert, at <br />
my nexword nighboor’s, and maybe more largely nor you <br />
quosh yet you, messmate, realise. A few times, so to shape, I chanced <br />
to be stretching, in the shadow as I thought, the liferight out <br />
of myself in my ericulous imaginating. I felt feeling a half Scotch <br />
and pottage like roung my middle ageing like Bewley in the <br />
baste so that I indicate out to myself and I swear my gots how <br />
that I’m not meself at al!, no jolly fear, when I realise bimiselves <br />
how becomingly I to be going to become.
<span class="em">—</span>O, is that the way with you, you craythur? In the becom- <br />
ing was the weared, wontnat! Hood maketh not frere. The voice <br />
is the voice of jokeup, I fear. Are you imitation Roma now or <br />
Amor now. You have all our empathies, eh, Mr Trickpat, if you <br />
don’t mind, that is, aside from sings and mush, answering to my <br />
straight question?
<span class="em">—</span>God save the monk! I won’t mind this is, answering to <br />
your strict crossqueets, whereas it would be as unethical for me <br />
now to answer as it would have been nonsensical for you then <br />
not to have asked. Same no can, home no will, gangin I am. <br />
Gangang is Mine and I will return. Out of my name you call me, <br />
Leelander. But in my shelter you’ll miss me. When Lapac walks <br />
backwords he’s darkest horse in Capalisoot. You knew me once <br />
but you won’t know me twice. I am simpliciter arduus, ars of <br />
the schoo, Freeday’s child in loving and thieving.
<span class="em">—</span>My child, know this! Some portion of that answer appears <br />
to have been token by you from the writings of Saint Synodius,<span></span></p>
