polises his egobruno most unwillingly seses by the mortal powers <br />
alionola equal and opposite brunoipso, id est, eternally provoking <br />
alio opposite equally as provoked as Bruno at being eternally <br />
opposed by Nola. Poor omniboose, singalow singelearum: so <br />
is he!

Starving today plays punk opening tomorrow two plays punk <br />
wire splosh how two plays punk Cabler. Have you forgotten <br />
poor Alby Sobrinos, Geoff, you blighter, identifiable by the <br />
necessary white patch on his rear? How he went to his swilters- <br />
land after his lungs, my sad late brother, before his coglionial <br />
expancian? Won’t you join me in a small halemerry, a bottle of <br />
the best, for wellmet Capeler, united Irishmen, what though pre- <br />
ferring the stranger, the coughs and the itches and the minnies <br />
and the ratties the opulose and bilgenses, for of his was the <br />
