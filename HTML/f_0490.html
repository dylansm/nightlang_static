<p class="ni">up bostoons. But whoewaxed he so anquished? Was he vector <br />
victored of victim vexed?
<span class="em">—</span>Mighty sure! Way way for his wehicul! A parambolator <br />
ram into his bagsmall when he was reading alawd, with two eco- <br />
lites and he’s been failing of that kink in his arts over sense.
<span class="em">—</span>Madonagh and Chiel, idealist leading a double life! But who, <br />
for the brilliance of brothers, is the Nolan as appearant nominally?
<span class="em">—</span>Mr Nolan is pronuminally Mr Gottgab.
<span class="em">—</span>I get it. By hearing his thing about a person one begins to <br />
place him for a certain in true. You reeker, he stands pat for <br />
you before a direct object in the feminine. I see. By maiden <br />
sname. Now, I am earnestly asking you, and putting it as <br />
between this yohou and that houmonymh, will just you search <br />
through your gabgut memoirs for all of two minutes for this <br />
impersonating pronolan, fairhead on foulshoulders. Would it be <br />
in twofold truth an untaken mispatriate, too fullfully true and <br />
rereally a doblinganger much about your own medium with a <br />
sandy whiskers? Poke me nabs in the ribs and pick the erstwort <br />
out of his mouth.
<span class="em">—</span>Treble Stauter of Holy Baggot Street, formerly Sword- <br />
meat, who I surpassed him lately for four and six bringing home <br />
the Christmas, as heavy as music, hand to eyes on the peer for <br />
Noel’s Arch, in blessed foster’s place is doing the dirty on me <br />
with his tantrums and all these godforgiven kilowatts I’d be <br />
better off without. She’s write to him she’s levt by me, Jenny <br />
Rediviva! Toot! Detter for you, Mr Nobru. Toot toot! Better for <br />
you, Mr Anol! This is the way we. Of a redtettetterday morning.
<span class="em">—</span>When your contraman from Tuwarceathay is looking for <br />
righting that is not a good sign? Not?
<span class="em">—</span>I speak truly, it’s a shower sign that it’s not.
<span class="em">—</span>What though it be for the sow of his heart? If even she <br />
were a good pool Pegeen?
<span class="em">—</span>If she ate your windowsill you wouldn’t say sow.
<span class="em">—</span>Would you be surprised after that my asking have you a <br />
bull, a bosbully, with a whistle in his tail to scare other birds?
<span class="em">—</span>I would.</p>
