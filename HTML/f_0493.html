<p class="ni">took a brief one in his shirtsails out of the alleged given mineral, <br />
telling me see his in Foraignghistan sambat papers Sunday feac- <br />
tures of a welcomed aperrytiff with vallad of Erill Pearcey O <br />
he never battered one eagle’s before paying me his duty on my <br />
annaversary to the parroteyes list in my nil ensemble, in his lazy- <br />
chair but he hidded up my hemifaces in all my mayarannies and <br />
he locked plum into my mirrymouth like Ysamasy morning in <br />
the end of time, with the so light’s hope on his ruddycheeks and <br />
rawjaws and, my charmer, whom I dipped my hand in, he simply <br />
showed me his propendiculous loadpoker, Seaserpents hisses <br />
sissastones, which was as then is produced in his mansway by <br />
this wisest of the Vikramadityationists, with the remere remind <br />
remure remark, in his gulughurutty: Yran for parasites with rum <br />
for the turkeycockeys so Lithia, M.D., as this is for Snooker, <br />
bort!
<span class="em">—</span>Which was said by whem to whom?
<span class="em">—</span>It wham. But whim I can’t whumember.
<span class="em">—</span>Fantasy! funtasy on fantasy, amnaes fintasies! And there is <br />
nihil nuder under the clothing moon. When Ota, weewahrwificle <br />
of Torquells, bumpsed her dumpsydiddle down in her woolsark <br />
she mode our heuteyleutey girlery of peerlesses to set up in all <br />
their bombossities of feudal fiertey, fanned, flounced and frangi- <br />
panned, while the massstab whereby Ephialtes has exceeded is the <br />
measure, simplex mendaciis, by which our Outis cuts his thruth. <br />
Arkaway now!
<span class="em">—</span>Yerds and nudes say ayes and noes! Vide! Vide!
<span class="em">—</span>Let Eivin bemember for Gates of Gold for their fadeless <br />
suns berayed her. Irise, Osirises! Be thy mouth given unto thee! <br />
For why do you lack a link of luck to poise a pont of perfect, <br />
peace? On the vignetto is a ragingoos. The overseer of the house <br />
of the oversire of the seas, Nu-Men, triumphant, sayeth: Fly as <br />
the hawk, cry as the corncrake, Ani Latch of the postern is thy <br />
name; shout!
<span class="em">—</span>My heart, my mother! My heart, my coming forth of <br />
darkness! They know not my heart, O coolun dearast! Mon <br />
gloomerie! Mon glamourie! What a surpraise, dear Mr Preacher,<span></span></p>
