<p class="ni">I to hear from your strawnummical modesty! Yes, there was <br />
that skew arch of chrome sweet home, floodlit up above the <br />
flabberghosted farmament and bump where the camel got the <br />
needle. Talk about iridecencies! Ruby and beryl and chrysolite, <br />
jade, sapphire, jasper and lazul.
<span class="em">—</span>Orca Bellona! Heavencry at earthcall, etnat athos? Extinct <br />
your vulcanology for the lava of Moltens!
<span class="em">—</span>It’s you not me’s in erupting, hecklar!
<span class="em">—</span>Ophiuchus being visible above thorizon, muliercula oc- <br />
cluded by Satarn’s serpent ring system, the pisciolinnies Nova <br />
Ardonis and Prisca Parthenopea, are a bonnies feature in the <br />
northern sky. Ers, Mores and Merkery are surgents below the rim <br />
of the Zenith Part while Arctura, Anatolia, Hesper and Mesembria <br />
weep in their mansions over Noth, Haste, Soot and Waste.
<span class="em">—</span>Apep and Uachet! Holy snakes, chase me charley, Eva’s <br />
got barley under her fluencies! The Ural Mount he’s on the <br />
move and he’ll quivvy her with his strombolo! Waddlewurst, <br />
the bag of tow, as broad above as he is below! Creeping <br />
through the liongrass and bullsrusshius, the obesendean, before <br />
the Emfang de Maurya’s class, in Bill Shasser’s Shotshrift writing <br />
academy, camouflaged as a blancmange and maple syrop! Obei- <br />
sance so their sitinins is the follicity of this Orp! Her sheik to <br />
Slave, his dick to Dave and the fat of the land to Guygas. The <br />
treadmill pebbledropper haha halfahead overground and she’d <br />
only chitschats in her spanking bee bonetry, Allapolloosa! Up the <br />
slanger! Three cheers and a heva heva for the name Dan Magraw!
<span class="em">—</span>The giant sun is in his emanence but which is chief of those <br />
white dwarfees of which he ever is surabanded? And do you think <br />
T might have being his seventh! He will kitssle me on melbaw. <br />
What about his age? says you. What about it? says I. I will <br />
confess to his sins and blush me further. I would misdemean to <br />
rebuke to the libels of snots from the fleshambles, the canalles. <br />
Synamite is too good for them. Two overthirties in shore shor- <br />
ties. She’s askapot at Nile Lodge and she’s citchincarry at the <br />
left Mrs Hamazum’s. Will you warn your old habasund, barking <br />
at baggermen, his chokefull chewing his chain? Responsif you<span></span></p>
