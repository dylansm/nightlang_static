<p class="ni">plais. The said Sully, a barracker associated with tinkers, the <br />
blackhand, Shovellyvans, wreuter of annoyimgmost letters and <br />
skirriless ballets in Parsee Franch who is Magrath’s thug and <br />
smells cheaply of Power’s spirits, like a deepsea dibbler, and he is <br />
not fit enough to throw guts down to a bear. Sylphling me <br />
when is a maid nought a maid he would go to anyposs length <br />
for her! So long, Sulleyman! If they cut his nose on the stitcher <br />
they had their sive n good reasons. Here’s to the leglift of my <br />
snuff and trout stockangt henkerchoff, orange fin with a mosaic <br />
of dispensations and a froren black patata, from my church milli- <br />
ner. When Lynch Brother, Withworkers, Friends and Company <br />
with T. C. King and the Warden of Galway is prepared to <br />
stretch him sacred by the powers to the starlight, L.B.W. Hemp, <br />
hemp, hurray! says the captain in the moonlight. I could put <br />
him under my pallyass and slepp on him all nights as I would <br />
roll myself for holy poly over his borrowing places. How we will <br />
make laugh over him together, me and my Riley in the Vickar’s <br />
bed! Quink! says I. He cawls to me Granny-stream-Auborne <br />
when I am hiding under my hair from him and I cool him my <br />
Finnyking he’s so joyant a bounder. Plunk! said he. Inasmuch <br />
as I am delightful to be able to state, with the joy of lifing in my <br />
forty winkers, that a handsome sovereign was freely pledged <br />
in their pennis in the sluts maschine, alonging wath a cherry- <br />
wickerkishabrack of maryfruit under Shadow La Rose, to both <br />
the legintimate lady performers of display unquestionable, Elsebett <br />
and Marryetta Gunning, H 2 O, by that noblesse of leechers at <br />
his Saxontannery with motto in Wwalshe’s ffrenchllatin: O’Neill <br />
saw Queen Molly’s pants: and much admired engraving, meaning <br />
complet manly parts during alleged recent act of our chief <br />
mergey margey magistrades, five itches above the kneecap, as <br />
required by statues. V.I.C.5.6. If you won’t release me stop to <br />
please me up the leg of me. Now you see! Respect. S.V.P. <br />
Your wife. Amn. Anm. Amm. Ann.
<span class="em">—</span>You wish to take us, Frui Mria, by degrees, as artis litterarum- <br />
que patrona but I am afraid, my poor woman of that same <br />
name, what with your silvanes and your salvines, you are misled.</p>
