<p class="c">SILENCE.</p>

<p>Act drop. Stand by! Blinders! Curtain up. Juice, please! Foots!
<span class="em">—</span>Hello! Are you Cigar shank and Wheat?
<span class="em">—</span>I gotye. Gobble Ann’s Carrot Cans.
<span class="em">—</span>Parfey. Now, after that justajiff siesta, just permit me a <br />
moment. Challenger’s Deep is childsplay to this but, by our <br />
soundings in the swish channels, land is due. A truce to demobbed <br />
swarwords. Clear the line, priority call! Sybil! Better that or <br />
this? Sybil Head this end! Better that way? Follow the baby spot. <br />
Yes. Very good now. We are again in the magnetic field. Do <br />
you remember on a particular lukesummer night, following a <br />
crying fair day? Moisten your lips for a lightning strike and begin <br />
again. Mind the flickers and dimmers! Better?
<span class="em">—</span>Well. The isles is Thymes. The ales is Penzance. Vehement <br />
Genral. Delhi expulsed.
<span class="em">—</span>Still calling of somewhave from its specific? Not more? <br />
Lesscontinuous. There were fires on every bald hill in holy <br />
Ireland that night. Better so?
<span class="em">—</span>You may say they were, son of a cove!
<span class="em">—</span>Were they bonfires? That clear?
<span class="em">—</span>No other name would at all befit them unless that. Bona- <br />
fieries! With their blue beards streaming to the heavens.
<span class="em">—</span>Was it a high white night now?
<span class="em">—</span>Whitest night mortal ever saw.
<span class="em">—</span>Was our lord of the heights nigh our lady of the valley?
<span class="em">—</span>He was hosting himself up and flosting himself around and <br />
ghosting himself to merry her murmur like an andeanupper <br />
balkan.
<span class="em">—</span>Lewd’s carol! Was there rain by any chance, mistandew?</p>
