<p class="ni">snow off walls. Have you ever heard of this old boy “Thom” or <br />
“Thim” of the fishy stare who belongs to Kimmage, a crofting dis- <br />
trict, and is not all there, and is all the more himself since he is <br />
not so, being most of his time down at the Green Man where he <br />
steals, pawns, belches and is a curse, drinking gaily two hours after <br />
closing time, with the coat on him skinside out against rappari- <br />
tions, with his socks outsewed his springsides, clapping his hands <br />
in a feeble sort of way and systematically mixing with the public <br />
going for groceries, slapping greats and littlegets soundly with <br />
his cattegut belts, flapping baresides and waltzywembling about <br />
in his accountrements always in font of the tubbernuckles, like <br />
a longarmed lugh, when he would be finished with his tea?
<span class="em">—</span>Is it that fellow? As mad as the brambles he is. Touch him. <br />
With the lawyers sticking to his trewsershins and the swatme- <br />
notting on the basque of his beret. He has kissed me more than <br />
once, I am sorry to say and if I did commit gladrolleries may the <br />
loone forgive it! O wait till I tell you!
<span class="em">—</span>We are not going yet.
<span class="em">—</span>And look here! Here’s, my dear, what he done, as snooks <br />
as I am saying so!
<span class="em">—</span>Get out, you dirt! A strangely striking part of speech for <br />
the hottest worked word of ur sprogue. You’re not! Unhindered <br />
and odd times? Mere thumbshow? Lately?
<span class="em">—</span>How do I know? Such my billet. Buy a barrack pass. Ask <br />
the horneys. Tell the robbers.
<span class="em">—</span>You are alluding to the picking pockets in Lower O’Connell <br />
Street?
<span class="em">—</span>I am illuding to the Pekin packet but I am eluding from <br />
Laura Connor’s treat.
<span class="em">—</span>Now, just wash and brush up your memoirias a little bit. <br />
So I find, referring to the pater of the present man, an erely de- <br />
mented brick thrower, I am wondering to myself in my mind, <br />
qua our arc of the covenant, was Toucher, a methodist, whose <br />
name, as others say, is not really ‘Thom’, was this salt son of a <br />
century from Boaterstown, Shivering William, the sealiest old for- <br />
ker ever hawked crannock, who is always with him at the Big Elm<span></span></p>
