<p><span class="em">—</span>Where do you get that wash? This representation does not <br />
accord with my experience. They were watching the watched <br />
watching. Vechers all.
<span class="em">—</span>Good. Hold that watching brief and keep this witching <br />
longuer. Now, retouching friend Tomsky, the enemy, did you <br />
gather much from what he let drop? We are sitting here for that.
<span class="em">—</span>I was rooshian mad, no lie. About his shapeless hat.
<span class="em">—</span>I suspect you must have been.
<span class="em">—</span>You are making your thunderous mistake. But I was dung <br />
sorry for him too.
<span class="em">—</span>O Schaum! Not really? Were you sorry you were mad <br />
with him then?
<span class="em">—</span>When I tell you I was rooshiamarodnimad with myself <br />
altogether, so I was, for being sorry for him.
<span class="em">—</span>So?
<span class="em">—</span>Absolutely.
<span class="em">—</span>Would you blame him at all stages?
<span class="em">—</span>I believe in many an old stager. But what seemed sooth to <br />
a Greek summed nooth to a giantle. Who kills the cat in Cairo <br />
coaxes cocks in Gaul.
<span class="em">—</span>I put it to you that this was solely in his sunflower state <br />
and that his haliodraping het was why maids all sighed for him, <br />
ventured and vied for him. Hm?
<span class="em">—</span>After Putawayo, Kansas, Liburnum and New Aimstir- <br />
dames, it wouldn’t surprise me in the very least.
<span class="em">—</span>That tare and this mole, your tear and our smile. ’Tis life <br />
that lies if woman’s eyes have been our old undoing. Lid efter lid. <br />
Reform in mine size his deformation. Tiffpuff up my nostril, <br />
would you puff the earthworm outer my ear.
<span class="em">—</span>He could claud boose his eyes to the birth of his garce, he <br />
could lump all his lot through the half of her play, but he jest <br />
couldn’t laugh through the whole of her farce becorpse he warn’t <br />
billed that way. So he outandouts his volimetangere and has a <br />
lightning consultation and he downadowns his pantoloogions <br />
and made a piece of first perpersonal puetry that staystale re- <br />
mains to be. Cleaned.</p>
