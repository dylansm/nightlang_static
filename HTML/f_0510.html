<p><span class="em">—</span>Booms of bombs and heavy rethudders?
<span class="em">—</span>This aim to you!
<span class="em">—</span>The tail, so mastrodantic, as you tell it nearly takes your <br />
own mummouth’s breath away. Your troppers are so unrelieved <br />
because his troopers were in difficulties. Still let stultitiam done <br />
in veino condone ineptias made of veritues. How many were <br />
married on that top of all strapping mornings, after the midnight <br />
turkay drive, my good watcher?
<span class="em">—</span>Puppaps. That’d be telling. With a hoh frohim and heh <br />
fraher. But, as regards to Tammy Thornycraft, Idefyne the lawn <br />
mare and the laney moweress and all the prentisses of wildes to <br />
massage him.
<span class="em">—</span>Now from Gunner Shotland to Guinness Scenography. <br />
Come to the ballay at the Tailors’ Hall. We mean to be mellay on <br />
the Mailers’ Mall. And leap, rink and make follay till the Gaelers’ <br />
Gall. Awake! Come, a wake! Every old skin in the leather world, <br />
infect the whole stock company of the old house of the Leaking <br />
Barrel, was thomistically drunk, two by two, lairking o’ tootlers <br />
with tombours a’beggars, the blog and turfs and the brandywine <br />
bankrompers, trou Normend fashion, I have been told down to <br />
the bank lean clorks? Some nasty blunt clubs were being operated <br />
after the tradition of a wellesleyan bottle riot act and a few plates <br />
were being shied about and tumblers bearing traces of fresh <br />
porter rolling around, independent of that, for the ehren of Fyn’s <br />
Insul, and then followed that wapping breakfast at the Heaven <br />
and Covenant, with Rodey O’echolowing how his breadcost on <br />
the voters would be a comeback for e’er a one, like the depre- <br />
dations of Scandalknivery, in and on usedtowobble sloops off <br />
cloasts, eh? Would that be a talltale too? This was the grandsire <br />
Orther. This was his innwhite horse. Sip?
<span class="em">—</span>Well, naturally he was, louties also genderymen. Being <br />
Kerssfesstiydt. They came from all lands beyond the wave for <br />
songs of Inishfeel. Whiskway and mortem! No puseyporcious <br />
either, invitem kappines all round. But the right reverend priest, <br />
Mr Hopsinbond, and the reverent bride eleft, Frizzy Fraufrau, <br />
were sober enough. I think they were sober.</p>
