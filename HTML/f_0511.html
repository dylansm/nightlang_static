<p><span class="em">—</span>I think you’re widdershins there about the right reverence. <br />
Magraw for the Northwhiggern cupteam was wedding beastman, <br />
papers before us carry. You saw him hurriedly, or did you if <br />
thatseme’s not irrelevant? With Slater’s hammer perhaps? Or he <br />
was in serge?
<span class="em">—</span>I horridly did. On the stroke of the dozen. I’m sure I’m <br />
wrong but I heard the irreverend Mr Magraw, in search of a <br />
stammer, kuckkuck kicking the bedding out of the old sexton, <br />
red-Fox Good-man around the sacristy, till they were bullbeadle <br />
black and bufeteer blue, while I and Flood and the other men, <br />
jazzlike brollies and sesuos, was gickling his missus to gackles in <br />
the hall, the divileen, (she’s a lamp in her throth) with her <br />
cygncygn leckle and her twelve pound lach.
<span class="em">—</span>A loyal wifish woman cacchinic wheepingcaugh! While <br />
she laylylaw was all their rage. But you did establish personal <br />
contact? In epexegesis or on a point of order?
<span class="em">—</span>That perkumiary pond is beyawnd my pinnigay pre- <br />
tonsions. I am resting on a pigs of cheesus but I’ve a big <br />
suggestion it was about the pint of porter.
<span class="em">—</span>You are a suckersome! But this all, as airs said to oska, <br />
as only that childbearer might blogas well sidesplit? Where <br />
letties hereditate a dark mien swart hairy?
<span class="em">—</span>Only. ‘Twas womans’ too woman with mans’ throw man.
<span class="em">—</span>Bully burley yet hardly hurley. The saloon bulkhead, did <br />
you say, or the tweendecks?
<span class="em">—</span>Between drinks, I deeply painfully repeat it.
<span class="em">—</span>Was she wearing shubladey’s tiroirs in humour of her <br />
hubbishobbis, Massa’s star stellar?
<span class="em">—</span>Mrs Tan-Taylour? Just a floating panel, secretairslid- <br />
ingdraws, a budge of klees on her schalter, a siderbrass sehdass <br />
on her anulas findring and forty crocelips in her curlingthongues.
<span class="em">—</span>So this was the dope that woolied the cad that kinked the <br />
ruck that noised the rape that tried the sap that hugged the mort?
<span class="em">—</span>That legged in the hoax that joke bilked.
<span class="em">—</span>The jest of junk the jungular?
<span class="em">—</span>Jacked up in a jock the wrapper.</p>
