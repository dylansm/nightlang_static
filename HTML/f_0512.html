<p><span class="em">—</span>Lollgoll! You don’t soye so! All upsydown her whole <br />
creation? So there was nothing serical between you? And Dry- <br />
salter, father of Izod, how was he now?
<span class="em">—</span>To the pink, man, like an allmanox in his shirt and stickup, <br />
brustall to the bear, the Megalomagellan of our winevatswater- <br />
way, squeezing the life out of the liffey.
<span class="em">—</span>Crestofer Carambas! Such is zodisfaction. You punk me! <br />
He came, he kished, he conquered. Vulturuvarnar! The must of <br />
his glancefull coaxing the beam in her eye? That musked bell of <br />
this masked ball! Annabella, Lovabella, Pullabella, yep?
<span class="em">—</span>Yup! Titentung Tollertone in S. Sabina’s. Aye aye, she <br />
was lithe and pleasable. Wilt thou the lee? Wilt thou the hee? <br />
Wilt thou the hussif?
<span class="em">—</span>The quicker the deef the safter the sapstaff, but the main <br />
the mightier the stricker the strait. To the vast go the game! It <br />
is the circumconversioning of antelithual paganelles by a hugger- <br />
knut cramwell energuman, or the caecodedition of an absque- <br />
litteris puttagonnianne to the herreraism of a cabotinesque ex- <br />
ploser?
<span class="em">—</span>I believe you. Taiptope reelly, O reely!
<span class="em">—</span>Nautaey, nautaey, we’re nowhere without ye! In steam of <br />
kavos now arbatos above our hearths doth hum. And Malkos <br />
crackles logs of fun while Anglys cheers our ingles. So lent she <br />
him ear to burrow his manhood (or so it appierce) and borrow <br />
his namas? Suilful eyes and sallowfoul hairweed and the sickly <br />
sigh from her gingering mouth like a Dublin bar in the moarning.
<span class="em">—</span>Primus auriforasti me.
<span class="em">—</span>The park is gracer than the hole, says she, but shekleton’s <br />
my fortune?
<span class="em">—</span>Eversought of being artained? You’ve soft a say with ye, <br />
Flatter O’Ford, that, honey, I hurdley chew you.
<span class="em">—</span>Is that answers?
<span class="em">—</span>It am queery!
<span class="em">—</span>The house was Toot and Come-Inn by the bridge called <br />
Tiltass, but are you solarly salemly sure, beyond the shatter of <br />
the canicular year? Nascitur ordo seculi numfit.</p>
