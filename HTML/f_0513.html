of&#8230;?
<span class="em">—</span>Amnis Dominae, Marcus of Corrig. A laughin hunter and <br />
Purty Sue.
<span class="em">—</span>And crazyheaded Jorn, the bulweh born?
<span class="em">—</span>Fluteful as his orkan. Ex ugola lenonem.
<span class="em">—</span>And Jambs, of Delphin’s Bourne or (as olders lay) of <br />
Tophat?
<span class="em">—</span>Dawncing the kniejinksky choreopiscopally like an easter <br />
sun round the colander, the vice! Taranta boontoday! You <br />
should pree him prance the polcat, you whould sniff him wops <br />

point?
<span class="em">—</span>Out of Prisky Poppagenua, the palsied old priamite, home <br />
from Edwin Hamilton’s Christmas pantaloonade, Oropos Roxy <br />
and Pantharhea at the Gaiety, trippudiating round the aria, with <br />
his fiftytwo heirs of age! They may reel at his likes but it’s Noeh <br />
Bonum’s shin do.
<span class="em">—</span>And whit what was Lillabil Issabil maideve, maid at?
<span class="em">—</span>Trists and thranes and trinies and traines.

<span class="em">—</span>The quobus quartet were there too, if I mistake not, as a <br />
sideline but, pace the contempt of senate, well to the fore, in an <br />
amenessy meeting, metandmorefussed to decide whereagainwhen <br />
to meet themselves flopsome and jerksome, lubber and deliric, <br />
drinking unsteadily through the Kerry quadrilles and Listowel <br />
lancers and mastersinging always with that consecutive fifth of <br />
theirs, eh? Like four wise elephants inandouting under a twelve- <br />
podestalled table?</p>
