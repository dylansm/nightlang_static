<p><span class="em">—</span>They were simple scandalmongers, that familiar, and all! <br />
Normand, Desmond, Osmund and Kenneth. Making mejical <br />
history all over the show!
<span class="em">—</span>In sum, some hum? And other marrage feats?
<span class="em">—</span>All our stakes they were astumbling round the ranky roars <br />
assumbling when Big Arthur flugged the field at Annie’s courting.
<span class="em">—</span>Suddenly some wellfired clay was cast out through the <br />
schappsteckers of hoy’s house?
<span class="em">—</span>Schottenly there was a hellfire club kicked out through the <br />
wasistas of Thereswhere.
<span class="em">—</span>Like Heavystost’s envil catacalamitumbling. Three days <br />
three times into the Vulcuum?
<span class="em">—</span>Punch!
<span class="em">—</span>Or Noe et Ecclesiastes, nonne?
<span class="em">—</span>Ninny, there is no hay in Eccles’s hostel.
<span class="em">—</span>Yet an I saw a sign of him, if you could scrape out his <br />
acquinntence? Name or redress him and we’ll call it a night! <br />
<span class="em">—</span>.i..’. .o..l.
<span class="em">—</span>You are sure it was not a shuler’s shakeup or a plighter’s <br />
palming or a winker’s wake etcaetera etcaeterorum you were at?
<span class="em">—</span>Precisely.
<span class="em">—</span>Mayhap. Hora pro Nubis, Thundersday, at A Little Bit Of <br />
Heaven Howth, the wife of Deimetuus (D’amn), Earl Adam Fitz- <br />
adam, of a Tartar (Birtha) or Sackville-Lawry and Morland- <br />
West, at the Auspice for the Living, Bonnybrook, by the river <br />
and A. Briggs Carlisle, guardian of the birdsmaids and deputil- <br />
iser for groom. Pontifical mess. Or (soddenly) Schott, furtivfired <br />
by the riots. No flies. Agreest?
<span class="em">—</span>Mayhem. Also loans through the post. With or without <br />
security. Everywhere. Any amount. Mofsovitz, swampstakers, <br />
purely providential.
<span class="em">—</span>Flood’s. The pinkman, the squeeze, the pint with the kick. <br />
Gaa. And then the punch to Gaelicise it. Fox. The lady with the <br />
lamp. The boy in the barleybag. The old man on his ars. Great <br />
Scrapp! ’Tis we and you and ye and me and hymns and hurts and <br />
heels and shields. The eirest race, the ourest nation, the airest place<span></span></p>
