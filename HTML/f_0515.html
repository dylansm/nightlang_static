<p class="ni">that erestationed. He was culping for penance while you were <br />
ringing his belle. Did the kickee, goodman rued fox, say anything <br />
important? Clam or cram, spick or spat?
<span class="em">—</span>No more than Richman’s periwhelker.
<span class="em">—</span>Nnn ttt wrd?
<span class="em">—</span>Dmn ttt thg.
<span class="em">—</span>A gael galled by scheme of scorn? Nock?
<span class="em">—</span>Sangnifying nothing. Mock!
<span class="em">—</span>Fortitudo eius rhodammum tenuit?
<span class="em">—</span>Five maim! Or something very similar.
<span class="em">—</span>I should like to euphonise that. It sounds an isochronism. <br />
Secret speech Hazelton and obviously disemvowelled. But it is <br />
good laylaw too. We may take those wellmeant kicks for free <br />
granted, though ultra vires, void and, in fact, unnecessarily so. <br />
Happily you were not quite so successful in the process verbal <br />
whereby you would sublimate your blepharospasmockical sup- <br />
pressions, it seems?
<span class="em">—</span>What was that? First I heard about it.
<span class="em">—</span>Were you or were you not? Ask yourself the answer, I’m <br />
not giving you a short question. Now, not to mix up, cast your <br />
eyes around Capel Court. I want you, witness of this epic struggle, <br />
as yours so mine, to reconstruct for us, as briefly as you can, in- <br />
exactly the same as a mind’s eye view, how these funeral games, <br />
which have been poring over us through homer’s kerryer pid- <br />
geons, massacreedoed as the holiname rally round took place.
<span class="em">—</span>Which? Sure I told you that afoul. I was drunk all lost life.
<span class="em">—</span>Well, tell it to me befair, the whole plan of campaign, in <br />
that bamboozelem mincethrill voice of yours. Let’s have it, <br />
christie! The Dublin own, the thrice familiar.
<span class="em">—</span>Ah, sure, I eyewitless foggus. ’Tis all around me bebatters- <br />
bid hat.
<span class="em">—</span>Ah, go on now, Masta Bones, a gig for a gag, with your <br />
impendements and your perroqtriques! Blank memory of hatless <br />
darky in blued suit. You were ever the gentle poet, dove from <br />
Haywarden. Pitcher cup, patcher cap, pratey man? Be nice about <br />
it, Bones Minor! Look chairful! Come, delicacy! Go to the end,<span></span></p>
