<p class="ni">thou slackerd! Once upon a grass and a hopping high grass it <br />
was.
<span class="em">—</span>Faith, then, Meesta Cheeryman, first he come up, a gag <br />
as a gig, badgeler’s rake to the town’s major from the wesz, <br />
MacSmashall Swingy of the Cattelaxes, got up regardless, with <br />
a cock on the Kildare side of his Tattersull, in his riddlesneek’s <br />
ragamufflers and the horrid contrivance as seen above, whisklyng <br />
into a bone tolerably delicately, the Wearing of the Blue, and taking <br />
off his plushkwadded bugsby in his perusual flea and loisy man- <br />
ner, saying good mrowkas to weevilybolly and dragging his feet <br />
in the usual course and was ever so terribly naas, really, telling <br />
him clean his nagles and fex himself up, Miles, and so on and so <br />
fort, and to take the coocoomb to his grizzlies and who done <br />
that foxy freak on his bear’s hairs like fire bursting out of the <br />
Ump pyre and, half hang me, sirr, if he wasn’t wanting his <br />
calicub body back before he’d to take his life or so save his life. <br />
Then, begor, counting as many as eleven to thritytwo seconds <br />
with his pocket browning, like I said, wann swanns wann, this is <br />
my awethorrorty, he kept forecursing hascupth’s foul Fanden, <br />
Cogan, for coaccoackey the key of John Dunn’s field fore it was <br />
for sent and the way Montague was robbed and wolfling to <br />
know all what went off and who burned the hay, perchance wilt <br />
thoult say, before he’d kill all the kanes and the price of Patsch <br />
Purcell’s faketotem, which the man, his plantagonist, up from the <br />
bog of the depths who was raging with the thirst of the sacred <br />
sponge and who, as a mashter of pasht, so far as him was con- <br />
cerned, was only standing there nonplush to the corner of Turbot <br />
Street, perplexing about a paumpshop and pupparing to spit, <br />
wanting to know whelp the henconvention’s compuss memphis <br />
he wanted with him new nothing about.
<span class="em">—</span>A sarsencruxer, like the Nap O’ Farrell Patter Tandy moor <br />
and burgess medley? In other words, was that how in the annusual <br />
curse of things, as complement to compliment though, after a <br />
manner of men which I must and will say seems extraordinary, <br />
their celicolar subtler angelic warfare or photoplay finister <br />
started?</p>
