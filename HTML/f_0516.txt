%ni%thou slackerd! Once upon a grass and a hopping high grass it  
was.
%—%Faith, then, Meesta Cheeryman, first he come up, a gag  
as a gig, badgeler’s rake to the town’s major from the wesz,  
MacSmashall Swingy of the Cattelaxes, got up regardless, with  
a cock on the Kildare side of his Tattersull, in his riddlesneek’s  
ragamufflers and the horrid contrivance as seen above, whisklyng  
into a bone tolerably delicately, the Wearing of the Blue, and taking  
off his plushkwadded bugsby in his perusual flea and loisy man-  
ner, saying good mrowkas to weevilybolly and dragging his feet  
in the usual course and was ever so terribly naas, really, telling  
him clean his nagles and fex himself up, Miles, and so on and so  
fort, and to take the coocoomb to his grizzlies and who done  
that foxy freak on his bear’s hairs like fire bursting out of the  
Ump pyre and, half hang me, sirr, if he wasn’t wanting his  
calicub body back before he’d to take his life or so save his life.  
Then, begor, counting as many as eleven to thritytwo seconds  
with his pocket browning, like I said, wann swanns wann, this is  
my awethorrorty, he kept forecursing hascupth’s foul Fanden,  
Cogan, for coaccoackey the key of John Dunn’s field fore it was  
for sent and the way Montague was robbed and wolfling to  
know all what went off and who burned the hay, perchance wilt  
thoult say, before he’d kill all the kanes and the price of Patsch  
Purcell’s faketotem, which the man, his plantagonist, up from the  
bog of the depths who was raging with the thirst of the sacred  
sponge and who, as a mashter of pasht, so far as him was con-  
cerned, was only standing there nonplush to the corner of Turbot  
Street, perplexing about a paumpshop and pupparing to spit,  
wanting to know whelp the henconvention’s compuss memphis  
he wanted with him new nothing about.
%—%A sarsencruxer, like the Nap O’ Farrell Patter Tandy moor  
and burgess medley? In other words, was that how in the annusual  
curse of things, as complement to compliment though, after a  
manner of men which I must and will say seems extraordinary,  
their celicolar subtler angelic warfare or photoplay finister  
started?
