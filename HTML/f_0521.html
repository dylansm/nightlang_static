<p class="ni">paperming comfirts d’yu draw for all yur swearin? The spanglers, <br />
kiddy?
<span class="em">—</span>Rootha prootha. There you have me! Vurry nothing, O <br />
potators, I call it for I might as well tell yous Essexelcy, and I <br />
am not swallowing my air, the Golden Bridge’s truth. It amounts <br />
to nada in pounds or pence. Not a glass of Lucan nor as much as <br />
the cost price of a highlandman’s trousertree or the three crowns <br />
round your draphole (isn’t it dram disgusting?) for the whole <br />
dumb plodding thing!
<span class="em">—</span>Come now, Johnny! We weren’t bom yesterday. Pro tanto <br />
quid retribuamus? I ask you to say on your scotty pictail you <br />
were promised fines times with some staggerjuice or deadhorse, <br />
on strip or in larges, at the Raven and Sugarloaf, either Jones’s <br />
lame or Jamesy’s gait, anyhow?
<span class="em">—</span>Bushmillah! Do you think for a moment? Yes, by the way. <br />
How very necessarily true! Give me fair play. When?
<span class="em">—</span>At the Dove and Raven tavern, no, ah? To wit your wiz- <br />
zend?
<span class="em">—</span>Water, water, darty water! Up Jubilee sod! Beet peat wheat <br />
treat!
<span class="em">—</span>What harm wants but demands it! How would you like to <br />
hear yur right name now, Ghazi Power, my tristy minstrel, if <br />
yur not freckened of frank comment?
<span class="em">—</span>Not afrightened of Frank Annybody’s gaspower or ill- <br />
conditioned ulcers neither.
<span class="em">—</span>Your uncles!
<span class="em">—</span>Your gullet!
<span class="em">—</span>Will you repeat that to me outside, leinconnmuns?
<span class="em">—</span>After you’ve shouted a few? I will when it suits me, <br />
hulstler.
<span class="em">—</span>Guid! We make fight! Three to one! Raddy?
<span class="em">—</span>But no, from exemple, Emania Raffaroo! What do you <br />
have? What mean you, august one? Fairplay for Finnians! I will <br />
have my humours. Sure, you would not do the cowardly thing <br />
and moll me roon? Tell Queen’s road I am seilling. Farewell, <br />
but whenever! Buy!</p>
