<p><span class="em">—</span>Ef I chuse to put a bullet like yu through the grill for <br />
heckling what business is that of yours, yu bullock?
<span class="em">—</span>I don’t know, sir. Don’t ask me, your honour!
<span class="em">—</span>Gently, gently Northern Ire! Love that red hand! Let me <br />
once more. There are sordidly tales within tales, you clearly <br />
understand that? Now my other point. Did you know, whether <br />
by melanodactylism or purely libationally, that one of these two <br />
Crimeans with the fender, the taller man, was accused of a cer- <br />
tain offence or of a choice of two serious charges, as skirts were <br />
divided on the subject, if you like it better that way? You did, <br />
you rogue, you?
<span class="em">—</span>You hear things. Besides (and serially now) bushes have <br />
eyes, don’t forget. Hah!
<span class="em">—</span>Which moral turpitude would you select of the two, for <br />
choice, if you had your way? Playing bull before shebears or the <br />
hindlegs off a clotheshorse? Did any orangepeelers or green- <br />
goaters appear periodically up your sylvan family tree?
<span class="em">—</span>Buggered if I know! It all depends on how much family <br />
silver you want for a nass-and-pair. Hah!
<span class="em">—</span>What do you mean, sir, behind your hah! You don’t hah <br />
to do thah, you know, snapograph.
<span class="em">—</span>Nothing, sir. Only a bone moving into place. Blotogaff. <br />
Hahah!
<span class="em">—</span>Whahat?
<span class="em">—</span>Are you to have all the pleasure quizzing on me? I didn’t <br />
say it aloud, sir. I have something inside of me talking to myself.
<span class="em">—</span>You’re a nice third degree witness, faith! But this is no <br />
laughing matter. Do you think we are tonedeafs in our noses to <br />
boot? Can you not distinguish the sense, prain, from the sound, <br />
bray? You have homosexual catheis of empathy between narcis- <br />
sism of the expert and steatopygic invertedness. Get yourself <br />
psychoanolised!
<span class="em">—</span>O, begor, I want no expert nursis symaphy from yours <br />
broons quadroons and I can psoakoonaloose myself any time I <br />
want (the fog follow you all!) without your interferences or any <br />
other pigeonstealer.</p>
