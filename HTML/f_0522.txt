%—%Ef I chuse to put a bullet like yu through the grill for  
heckling what business is that of yours, yu bullock?
%—%I don’t know, sir. Don’t ask me, your honour!
%—%Gently, gently Northern Ire! Love that red hand! Let me  
once more. There are sordidly tales within tales, you clearly  
understand that? Now my other point. Did you know, whether  
by melanodactylism or purely libationally, that one of these two  
Crimeans with the fender, the taller man, was accused of a cer-  
tain offence or of a choice of two serious charges, as skirts were  
divided on the subject, if you like it better that way? You did,  
you rogue, you?
%—%You hear things. Besides (and serially now) bushes have  
eyes, don’t forget. Hah!
%—%Which moral turpitude would you select of the two, for  
choice, if you had your way? Playing bull before shebears or the  
hindlegs off a clotheshorse? Did any orangepeelers or green-  
goaters appear periodically up your sylvan family tree?
%—%Buggered if I know! It all depends on how much family  
silver you want for a nass-and-pair. Hah!
%—%What do you mean, sir, behind your hah! You don’t hah  
to do thah, you know, snapograph.
%—%Nothing, sir. Only a bone moving into place. Blotogaff.  
Hahah!
%—%Whahat?
%—%Are you to have all the pleasure quizzing on me? I didn’t  
say it aloud, sir. I have something inside of me talking to myself.
%—%You’re a nice third degree witness, faith! But this is no  
laughing matter. Do you think we are tonedeafs in our noses to  
boot? Can you not distinguish the sense, prain, from the sound,  
bray? You have homosexual catheis of empathy between narcis-  
sism of the expert and steatopygic invertedness. Get yourself  
psychoanolised!
%—%O, begor, I want no expert nursis symaphy from yours  
broons quadroons and I can psoakoonaloose myself any time I  
want (the fog follow you all!) without your interferences or any  
other pigeonstealer.
