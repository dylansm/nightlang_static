<span class="em">—</span>Have you ever weflected, wepowtew, that the evil what <br />

<span class="em">—</span>A pwopwo of haster meets waster and talking of plebiscites <br />
by a show of hands, whether declaratory or effective, in all <br />
seriousness, has it become to dawn in you yet that the deponent, <br />
the man from Saint Yves, may have been (one is reluctant to use <br />
the passive voiced) may be been as much sinned against as sin- <br />
ning, for if we look at it verbally perhaps there is no true noun in <br />
active nature where every bally being<span class="em">—</span>please read this mufto <br />

West Pauper Bosquet, was glad to be back again with the chaps <br />

a wee chatty with our hosty in his comfy estably over the old <br />
middlesex party and his moral turps, meaning flu, pock, pox <br />
and mizzles, grip, gripe, gleet and sprue, caries, rabies, numps <br />
and dumps. What me and Frisky in our concensus and the whole <br />
double gigscrew of suscribers, notto say the burman, having <br />
successfully concluded our tour of bibel, wants to know is thisa- <br />
