<p class="ni">land him yet, slitheryscales on liffeybank, times and times and <br />
halve a time with a pillow of sand to polster him.
<span class="em">—</span>Do you say they will?
<span class="em">—</span>I bet you they will.
<span class="em">—</span>Among the shivering sedges so? Weedy waving.
<span class="em">—</span>Or tulipbeds of Rush below.
<span class="em">—</span>Where you take your mugs to wash after dark?
<span class="em">—</span>To my lead, Toomey lout, Tommy lad.
<span class="em">—</span>Besides the bubblye waters of, babblyebubblye waters of?
<span class="em">—</span>Right.
<span class="em">—</span>Grenadiers. And tell me now. Were these anglers or angel- <br />
ers coexistent and compresent with or without their tertium quid?
<span class="em">—</span>Three in one, one and three. <br />
Shem and Shaun and the shame that sunders em. <br />
Wisdom’s son, folly’s brother.
<span class="em">—</span>God bless your ginger, wigglewaggle! That’s three slots <br />

What, Walker John Referent? Play us your patmost! And un- <br />

<span class="em">—</span>Naif Cruachan! Woe on woe, says Wardeb Daly. Woman <br />
will water the wild world over. And the maid of the folley will go <br />

MacGarry, he was, hand to dagger, that time and their mother, a <br />
rawkneepudsfrowse, I was given to understand, with superflow- <br />
vius heirs, begum. There was that one that was always mad gone <br />
on him, her first king of cloves and the most broadcussed man <br />
in Corrack-on-Sharon, County Rosecarmon. Sure she was near <br />
drowned in pondest coldstreams of admiration forherself, as bad <br />
as my Tarpeyan cousin, Vesta Tully, making faces at her bach- <br />
spilled likeness in the brook after and cooling herself in the <br />
element, she pleasing it, she praising it, with salices and weidow- <br />
wehls, all tossed, as she was, the playactrix, Lough Shieling’s love!
<span class="em">—</span>O, add shielsome bridelittle! All of her own! Nircississies <br />

classes becoming poolermates in laker life.</p>
