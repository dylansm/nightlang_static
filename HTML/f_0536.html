<p class="ni">spirit, called Sebastion, from the Rivera in Januero, (he is not <br />
all hear) may fernspreak shortly with messuages from my dead- <br />
ported. Let us cheer him up a little and make an appunkment for <br />
a future date. Hello, Commudicate! How’s the buttes? Ever- <br />
scepistic! He does not believe in our psychous of the Real Ab- <br />
sence, neither miracle wheat nor soulsurgery of P. P. Quemby. <br />
He has had some indiejestings, poor thing, for quite a little while, <br />
confused by his tonguer of baubble. A way with him! Poor Felix <br />
Culapert! Ring his mind, ye staples, (bonze!) in my ould reeke- <br />
ries’ ballyheart and in my krumlin and in aroundisements and <br />
stremmis! Sacks eleathury! Sacks eleathury! Bam! I deplore over <br />
him ruely. Mongrieff! O Hone! Guestermed with the nobelities, <br />
to die bronxitic in achershous! So enjoying of old thick whiles, <br />
in haute white toff’s hoyt of our formed reflections, with stock <br />
of eisen all his prop, so buckely hosiered from the Royal Leg, <br />
and his puertos mugnum, he would puffout a dhymful bock. <br />
And the how he would husband her that verikerfully, his cigare <br />
divane! (He would redden her with his vestas, but ’tis naught.) <br />
With us his nephos and his neberls, mest incensed and befogged <br />
by him and his smoke thereof. But he shall have his glad stein of <br />
our zober beerbest in Oscarshal’s winetavern. Buen retiro! The <br />
boyce voyce is still flautish and his mounth still wears that <br />
soldier’s scarlet though the flaxafloyeds are peppered with salse- <br />
dine. It is bycause of what he was ascend into his prisonce on <br />
account off. I whit it wel. Hence his deepraised words. Some day <br />
I may tell of his second storey. Mood! Mood! It looks like some- <br />
one other bearing my burdens. I cannot let it. Kanes nought.</p>

<p>Well, yeamen, I have bared my whole past, I flatter myself, <br />
on both sides. Give me even two months by laxlaw in second <br />
division and my first broadcloth is business will be to protest to <br />
Recorder at Thing of all Things, or court of Skivinis, with mar- <br />
chants grey, antient and credibel, Zerobubble Barrentone, Jonah <br />
Whalley, Determined Codde or Cucumber Upright, my jurats, <br />
if it does not occur again. O rhyme us! Haar Faagher, wild heart <br />
in Homelan; Harrod’s be the naun. Mine kinder come, mine <br />
wohl be won. There is nothing like leuther. O Shee! And nosty<span></span></p>
