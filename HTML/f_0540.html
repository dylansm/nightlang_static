<p class="ni">toothed dragon worms with allsort serpents, has compolitely <br />
seceded from this landleague of many nations and open and <br />
notorious naughty livers are found not on our rolls. This seat of <br />
our city it is of all sides pleasant, comfortable and wholesome. <br />
If you would traverse hills, they are not far off. If champain land, <br />
it lieth of all parts. If you would be delited with fresh water, the <br />
famous river, called of Ptolemy the Libnia Labia, runneth fast <br />
by. If you will take the view of the sea, it is at hand. Give heed!
<span class="em">—</span>Do Drumcollogher whatever you do!
<span class="em">—</span>Visitez Drumcollogher-la-Belle!
<span class="em">—</span>Be suke ad sie so ersed Drumcollogher!
<span class="em">—</span>Vedi Drumcollogher e poi Moonis.
<span class="em">—</span>Things are not as they were. Let me briefly survey. Pro clam <br />
a shun! Pip! Peep! Pipitch! Ubipop jay piped, ibipep goes the <br />
whistle. Here Tyeburn throttled, massed murmars march: where <br />
the bus stops there shop I: here which ye see, yea reste. On me, <br />
your sleeping giant. Estoesto! Estote sunto! From the hold of <br />
my capt in altitude till the mortification that’s my fate. The end <br />
of aldest mosest ist the beginning of all thisorder so the last of <br />
their hansbailis shall the first in our sheriffsby. New highs for <br />
all! Redu Negru may be black in tawn but under them lintels <br />
are staying my horneymen meet each his mansiemagd. For peers <br />
and gints, quaysirs and galleyliers, fresk letties from the say and <br />
stale headygabblers, gaingangers and dudder wagoners, pullars <br />
off societies and pushers on rothmere’s homes. Obeyance from <br />
the townsmen spills felixity by the toun. Our bourse and politico- <br />
ecomedy are in safe with good Jock Shepherd, our lives are on <br />
sure in sorting with Jonathans, wild and great. Been so free! <br />
Thank you, besters! Hattentats have mindered. Blaublaze devil- <br />
bobs have gone from the mode and hairtrigger nicks are quite <br />
out of time now. Thuggeries are reere as glovars’ metins, lepers <br />
lack, ignerants show beneath suspicion like the bitterhalves of <br />
esculapuloids. In midday’s mallsight let Miledd discurverself. <br />
Me ludd in her hide park seek Minuinette. All is waldy bonums. <br />
Blownose aerios we luft to you! Firebugs, good blazes! Lubbers, <br />
kepp your poudies drier! Seamen, we segn your skivs and wives!<span></span></p>
