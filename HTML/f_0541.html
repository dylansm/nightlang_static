fordrock, the Calton, the Liberton, Craig and Lockhart’s, A. <br />
Costofino, R. Thursitt. The chort of Nicholas Within was my <br />
guide and I raised a dome on the wherewithouts of Michan: by <br />
awful tors my wellworth building sprang sky spearing spires, <br />
cloud cupoled campaniles: further this. By fineounce and im- <br />

and my drains for render and prender the doles and the tribute: <br />
I was merely out of my mint with all the percussors on my <br />
braincap till I struck for myself and muched morely by token: to <br />
Sirrherr of Gambleden ruddy money, to Madame of Pitymount <br />

Under law’s marshall and warschouw did I thole till lead’s <br />

Who can tell their tale whom I filled ad liptum on the plain of <br />
Soulsbury? With three hunkered peepers and twa and twas! <br />
For sleeking beauties I spinned their nightinveils, to slumbred <br />
beast I tummed the thief air. Round the musky moved a mur- <br />

tunes like water parted fluted up from the westinders while from <br />
