<p class="ni">reized spudfully from the murphyplantz Hawkinsonia and berri- <br />
berries from the pletoras of the Irish shou. I heard my liberti- <br />
lands making free through their curraghcoombs, my trueblues <br />
hurusalaming before Wailingtone’s Wall: I richmounded the <br />
rainelag in my bathtub of roundwood and conveyed it with <br />
cheers and cables, roaring mighty shouts, through my longer- <br />
tubes of elm: out of fundness for the outozone I carried them <br />
amd curried them in my Putzemdown cars to my Kommeandine <br />
hotels: I made sprouts fontaneously from Philuppe Sobriety in <br />
the coupe that’s cheyned for noon inebriates: when they weaned <br />
weary of that bibbing I made infusion more infused: sowerpacers <br />
of the vinegarth, obtemperate unto me! When you think me in <br />
my coppeecuffs look in ware would you meckamockame, as you <br />
pay in caabman’s sheltar tot the ites like you corss the tees. <br />
W\herefore watch ye well! For, while I oplooked the first of <br />
Janus’s straight, I downsaw the last of Christmas steps: syndic <br />
podestril and on the rates, I for indigent and intendente: in <br />
Forum Foster I demosthrenated my folksfiendship, enmy pupuls <br />
felt my burk was no worse than their brite: Sapphrageta and <br />
Consciencia were undecidedly attached to me but the maugher <br />
machrees and the auntieparthenopes my schwalby words with <br />
litted spongelets set their soakye pokeys and botchbons afume: <br />
Fletcher-Flemmings, elisaboth, how interquackeringly they ro- <br />
gated me, their golden one, I inhesitant made replique: Mesde- <br />
memdes to leursieuresponsor: and who in hillsaide, don’t you <br />
let flyfire till you see their whites of the bunkers’ eyes! Mr An- <br />
swers: Brimgem young, bringem young, bringem young!: in <br />
my bethel of Solyman’s I accouched their rotundaties and I turn- <br />
keyed most insultantly over raped lutetias in the lock: I gave bax <br />
of biscums to the jacobeaters and pottage bakes to the esausted; <br />
I dehlivered them with freakandesias by the constant droppings <br />
from my smalls instalmonths while I titfortotalled up their <br />
farinadays for them on my slataper’s slate with my chandner’s <br />
chauk: I jaunted on my jingelbrett rapt in neckloth and sashes, <br />
and I beggered about the amnibushes like belly in a bowle. In <br />
the humanity of my heart I sent out heyweywomen to refresh<span></span></p>
