berries from the pletoras of the Irish shou. I heard my liberti-  
lands making free through their curraghcoombs, my trueblues  
hurusalaming before Wailingtone’s Wall: I richmounded the  
rainelag in my bathtub of roundwood and conveyed it with  
cheers and cables, roaring mighty shouts, through my longer-  
tubes of elm: out of fundness for the outozone I carried them  
amd curried them in my Putzemdown cars to my Kommeandine  
hotels: I made sprouts fontaneously from Philuppe Sobriety in  
the coupe that’s cheyned for noon inebriates: when they weaned  
weary of that bibbing I made infusion more infused: sowerpacers
