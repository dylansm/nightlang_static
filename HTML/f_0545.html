in morgenattics litt I hope, in seralcellars louched I bleakmealers: <br />
on my siege of my mighty I was parciful of my subject but in street <br />
wauks that are darkest I debelledem superb: I deemed the drugtails <br />
in my pettycourts and domstered dustyfeets in my husinclose: at <br />
Guy’s they were swathed, at Foulke’s slashed, the game for a <br />
Gomez, the loy for a lynch: if I was magmonimoss as staidy lavgiver <br />
