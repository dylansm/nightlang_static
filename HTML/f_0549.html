<p class="ni">Danabrog (Cunnig’s great! Soll leve! Soll leve!): with mare’s <br />
greese cressets at Leonard’s and Dunphy’s and Madonna lan- <br />
thorns before quintacasas and tallonkindles spearhead syngeing <br />
nickendbookers and mhutton lightburnes dipdippingdownes in <br />
blackholes, the tapers of the topers and his buntingpall at hoist: <br />
for days there was no night for nights were days and our folk had <br />
rest from Blackheathen and the pagans from the prince of pacis: <br />
what was trembling sod quaked no more, what were frozen loins <br />
were stirred and lived: gone the septuor, dark deadly dismal dole- <br />
ful desolate dreadful desperate, no more the tolvmaans, bloody <br />
gloomy hideous fearful furious alarming terrible mournful <br />
sorrowful frightful appalling: peace, perfect peace: and I hung up <br />
at Yule my duindleeng lunas, helphelped of Kettil Flashnose, for <br />
the souperhore of my frigid one, coloumba mea, frimosa mea, in <br />
Wastewindy tarred strate and Elgin’s marble halles lamping <br />
limp from black to block, through all Livania’s volted ampire, <br />
from anodes to cathodes and from the topazolites of Mourne, <br />
Wykinloeflare, by Arklow’s sapphire siomen’s lure and Wexter- <br />
ford’s hook and crook lights to the polders of Hy Kinsella: <br />
avenyue ceen my peurls ahumming, the crown to my estuarine <br />
munipicence?: three firths of the sea I swept with draughtness <br />
and all ennempties I bottled em up in bellomport: when I stab- <br />
marooned jack and maturin I was a bad boy’s bogey but it was <br />
when I went on to sankt piotersbarq that they gave my devil his <br />
dues: what is seizer can hack in the old wold a sawyer may hew <br />
in the green: on the island of Breasil the wildth of me perished <br />
and I took my plowshure sadly, feeling pity for me sored: where <br />
bold O’Connee weds on Alta Mahar, the tawny sprawling beside <br />
that silver burn, I sate me and settled with the little crither of my <br />
hearth: her intellects I charmed with I calle them utile thoughts, <br />
her turlyhyde I plumped with potatums for amiens pease in <br />
plenty: my biblous beadells shewed her triumphs of craftygild <br />
pageantries, loftust Adam, duffed our cousterclother, Conn and <br />
Owel with cortoppled baskib, Sire Noeh Guinnass, exposant of <br />
his bargeness and Lord Joe Starr to hump the body of the camell: <br />
