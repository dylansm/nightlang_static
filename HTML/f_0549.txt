%ni%Danabrog (Cunnig’s great! Soll leve! Soll leve!): with mare’s  
greese cressets at Leonard’s and Dunphy’s and Madonna lan-  
thorns before quintacasas and tallonkindles spearhead syngeing  
nickendbookers and mhutton lightburnes dipdippingdownes in  
blackholes, the tapers of the topers and his buntingpall at hoist:  
for days there was no night for nights were days and our folk had  
rest from Blackheathen and the pagans from the prince of pacis:  
what was trembling sod quaked no more, what were frozen loins  
were stirred and lived: gone the septuor, dark deadly dismal dole-  
ful desolate dreadful desperate, no more the tolvmaans, bloody  
gloomy hideous fearful furious alarming terrible mournful  
sorrowful frightful appalling: peace, perfect peace: and I hung up  
at Yule my duindleeng lunas, helphelped of Kettil Flashnose, for  
the souperhore of my frigid one, coloumba mea, frimosa mea, in  
Wastewindy tarred strate and Elgin’s marble halles lamping  
limp from black to block, through all Livania’s volted ampire,  
from anodes to cathodes and from the topazolites of Mourne,  
Wykinloeflare, by Arklow’s sapphire siomen’s lure and Wexter-  
ford’s hook and crook lights to the polders of Hy Kinsella:  
avenyue ceen my peurls ahumming, the crown to my estuarine  
munipicence?: three firths of the sea I swept with draughtness  
and all ennempties I bottled em up in bellomport: when I stab-  
marooned jack and maturin I was a bad boy’s bogey but it was  
when I went on to sankt piotersbarq that they gave my devil his  
dues: what is seizer can hack in the old wold a sawyer may hew  
in the green: on the island of Breasil the wildth of me perished  
and I took my plowshure sadly, feeling pity for me sored: where  
bold O’Connee weds on Alta Mahar, the tawny sprawling beside  
that silver burn, I sate me and settled with the little crither of my  
hearth: her intellects I charmed with I calle them utile thoughts,  
her turlyhyde I plumped with potatums for amiens pease in  
plenty: my biblous beadells shewed her triumphs of craftygild  
pageantries, loftust Adam, duffed our cousterclother, Conn and  
Owel with cortoppled baskib, Sire Noeh Guinnass, exposant of  
his bargeness and Lord Joe Starr to hump the body of the camell:  
I screwed the Emperor down with ninepins gaelic with sixpenny-%j%
