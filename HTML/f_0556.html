<p>night by silentsailing night while infantina Isobel (who will be <br />
blushing all day to be, when she growed up one Sunday, <br />
Saint Holy and Saint Ivory, when she took the veil, the <br />
beautiful presentation nun, so barely twenty, in her pure coif, <br />
sister Isobel, and next Sunday, Mistlemas, when she looked <br />
a peach, the beautiful Samaritan, still as beautiful and still <br />
in her teens, nurse Saintette Isabelle, with stiffstarched cuffs but <br />
on Holiday, Christmas, Easter mornings when she wore a wreath, <br />
the wonderful widow of eighteen springs, Madame Isa Veuve La <br />
Belle, so sad but lucksome in her boyblue’s long black with <br />
orange blossoming weeper’s veil) for she was the only girl they <br />

neath of the whitethorn, child of tree, like some losthappy leaf, <br />
like blowing flower stilled, as fain would she anon, for soon again <br />
