<p class="ni">two or three hours of close confabulation, by this pewterpint of <br />
Gilbey’s goatswhey which is his prime consolation, albeit in- <br />
volving upon the same no uncertain amount of esophagous re- <br />
gurgitation, he being personally unpreoccupied to the extent of <br />
a flea’s gizzard anent eructation, if he was still extremely offen- <br />
sive to a score and four nostrils’ dilatation, still he was likewise, <br />
on the other side of him, for some nepmen’s eyes a delectation, as <br />
he asserts without the least alienation, so prays of his faullt you <br />
would make obliteration but for our friend behind the bars, <br />
though like Adam Findlater, a man of estimation, summing him <br />
up to be done, be what will of excess his exaltation, still we think <br />
with Sully there can be no right extinuation for contravention <br />
of common and statute legislation for which the fit remedy <br />
resides, for Mr Sully, in corporal amputation: so three months for <br />

never happier, huhu, than when they were miserable, haha;</p>

<p>in their bed of trial, on the bolster of hardship, by the glimmer <br />
of memory, under coverlets of cowardice, Albatrus Nyanzer with <br />
