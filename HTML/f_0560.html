<p class="ni">after to queen’s lead. Promiscuous Omebound to Fiammelle la <br />
Diva. Huff! His move. Blackout.</p>

<p>Circus. Corridor.</p>

<p>Shifting scene. Wall flats: sink and fly. Spotlight working wall <br />
cloths. Spill playing rake and bridges. Room to sink: stairs to <br />
sink behind room. Two pieces. Haying after queue. Replay.</p>

<p>The old humburgh looks a thing incomplete so. It is so. On its <br />
dead. But it will pawn up a fine head of porter when it is finished. <br />
In the quicktime. The castle arkwright put in a chequered staircase <br />
certainly. It has only one square step, to be steady, yet notwith- <br />
stumbling are they stalemating backgammoner supstairs by skips <br />
and trestles tiltop double corner. Whist while and game.</p>

<p>What scenic artist! It is ideal residence for realtar. By hims <br />
ingang tilt tinkt a tunning bell that Limen Mr, that Boggey <br />
Godde, be airwaked. Lingling, lingling. Be their maggies in all. <br />
Chump, do your ephort. Shop! Please shop! Shop ado please! <br />
O ado please shop! How hominous his house, haunt it? Yesses <br />
indead it be! Nogen, of imperial measure, is begraved beneadher. <br />
Here are his naggins poured, his alladim lamps. Around the <br />
bloombiered, booty with the bedst. For them whom he have <br />
fordone make we newly thankful!</p>

<p>Tell me something. The Porters, so to speak, after their <br />
shadowstealers in the newsbaggers, are very nice people, are they <br />
not? Very, all fourlike tellt. And on this wise, Mr, Porter (Bar- <br />
tholomew, heavy man, astern, mackerel shirt, hayamatt peruke) <br />
is an excellent forefather and Mrs Porter (leading lady, a <br />
poopahead, gaffneysaffron nightdress, iszoppy chepelure) is a <br />
most kindhearted messmother. A so united family pateramater <br />
is not more existing on papel or off of it. As keymaster fits the <br />
lock it weds so this bally builder to his streamline secret. They <br />
care for nothing except everything that is allporterous. Porto <br />
da Brozzo! Isn’t that terribly nice of them? You can ken that they <br />
come of a rarely old family by their costumance and one must <br />
togive that one supped of it in all tonearts from awe to zest. I <br />
think I begin to divine so much. Only snakkest me truesome! I <br />
stone us I’m hable.</p>
