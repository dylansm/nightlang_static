<p>To reachy a skeer do! Still hoyhra, till venstra! Here are two <br />
rooms on the upstairs, at forkflank and at knifekanter. Whom in <br />
the wood are they for? Why, for little Porter babes, to be saved! <br />
The coeds, boytom thwackers and timbuy teaser. Here is one. <br />
thing you owed two noe. This one once upon awhile was the <br />
other but this is the other one nighadays. Ah so? The Corsicos? <br />
They are numerable. Guest them. Major bed, minor bickhive. <br />
Halosobuth, sov us! Who sleeps in now number one, for ex- <br />
ample? A pussy, purr esimple. Cunina, Statulina and Edulia, <br />
but how sweet of her! Has your pussy a pessname? Yes, indeed, <br />
you will hear it passim in all the noveletta and she is named <br />
Buttercup. Her bare name will tellt it, a monitress. How very <br />
sweet of her and what an excessively lovecharming missyname <br />
to forsake, now that I come to drink of it filtred, a gracecup <br />
fulled of bitterness. She is dadad’s lottiest daughterpearl and <br />
brooder’s cissiest auntybride. Her shellback thimblecasket mirror <br />
only can show her dearest friendeen. To speak well her grace <br />
it would ask of Grecian language, of her goodness, that legend <br />
golden. Biryina Saindua! Loreas with lillias flocaflake arrosas! <br />
Here’s newyearspray, the posquiflor, a windaborne and helio- <br />
trope; there miriamsweet and amaranth and marygold to crown. <br />
Add lightest knot unto tiptition. O Charis! O Charissima! <br />
A more intriguant bambolina could one not colour up out <br />
of Boccuccia’s Enameron. Would one but to do apart a lilybit her <br />
virginelles and, so, to breath, so, therebetween, behold, she had <br />
instantt with her handmade as to graps the myth inmid the air. <br />
Mother of moth! I will to show herword in flesh. Approach not for <br />
ghost sake! Itis dormition! She may think, what though little doth <br />
she realise, as morning fresheth, it hath happened her, you know <br />
what, as they too what two dare not utter. Silvoo plush, if scolded <br />
she draws a face. Petticoat’s asleep but in the gentlenest of her <br />
thoughts apoo is a nursepin. To be presented, Babs for Bim- <br />
bushi? Of courts and with enticers. Up, girls, and at him! Alone? <br />
Alone what? I mean, our strifestirrer, does she do fleurty winkies <br />
with herself Pussy is never alone, as records her chambrette, for <br />
she can always look at Biddles and talk petnames with her little<span></span></p>
