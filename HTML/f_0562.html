<p class="ni">playfilly when she is sitting downy on the ploshmat. O, she <br />
talks, does she? Marry, how? Rosepetalletted sounds. Ah Biddles <br />
es ma plikplak. Ah plikplak wed ma Biddles. A nice jezebel bary- <br />
tinette she will gift but I much prefer her missnomer in maidenly <br />
golden lasslike gladsome wenchful flowery girlish beautycapes. <br />
So do I, much. Dulce delicatissima! Doth Dolly weeps she is <br />
hastings. Will Dally bumpsetty it is tubtime. Allaliefest, she who <br />
pities very pebbles, dare we not wish on her our thrice onsk? <br />
A lovely fear! That she seventip toe her chrysming, that she spin <br />
blue to scarlad till her temple’s veil, that the Mount of Whoam it <br />
open it her to shelterer! She will blow ever so much more pro- <br />
misefuller, blee me, than all the other common marygales that <br />
romp round brigidschool, charming Carry Whambers or saucy <br />
Susy Maucepan of Merry Anna Patchbox or silly Polly Flinders. <br />
Platsch! A plikaplak.</p>

<p>And since we are talking amnessly of brukasloop crazedledaze, <br />
who doez in sleeproom number twobis? The twobirds. Holy <br />
policeman, O, I see! Of what age are your birdies? They are to <br />
come of twinning age so soon as they may be born to be elder- <br />
ing like those olders while they are living under chairs. They are <br />
and they seem to be so tightly tattached as two maggots to touch <br />
other, I think I notice, do I not? You do. Our bright bull babe <br />
Frank Kevin is on heartsleeveside. Do not you waken him! Our <br />
farheard bode. He is happily to sleep, limb of the Lord, with his <br />
lifted in blessing, his buchel Iosa, like the blissed angel he looks so <br />
like and his mou is semiope as though he were blowdelling on a <br />
bugigle. Whene’er I see those smiles in eyes ’tis Father Quinn <br />
again. Very shortly he will smell sweetly when he will hear a weird <br />
to wean. By gorgeous, that boy will blare some knight when he will <br />
take his dane’s pledges and quit our ingletears, spite of undesirable <br />
parents, to wend him to Amorica to quest a cashy job. That keen <br />
dean with his veen nonsolance! O, I adore the profeen music! <br />
Dollarmighty! He is too audorable really, eunique! I guess to <br />
have seen somekid like him in the story book, guess I met some- <br />
where somelam to whom he will be becoming liker. But hush! <br />
How unpardonable of me! I beg for your venials, sincerely I do.</p>
