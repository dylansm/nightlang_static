<p>Hush! The other, twined on codliverside, has been crying in <br />
his sleep, making sharpshape his inscissors on some first choice <br />
sweets fished out of the muck. A stake in our mead. What a <br />
teething wretch! How his book of craven images! Here are post- <br />
humious tears on his intimelle. And he has pipettishly bespilled <br />
himself from his foundingpen as illspent from inkinghorn. He is <br />
jem job joy pip poo pat (jot um for a sobrat!) Jerry Jehu. You will <br />
know him by name in the capers but you cannot see whose heel he <br />
sheepfolds in his wrought hand because I have not told it to you. <br />
O, foetal sleep! Ah, fatal slip! the one loved, the other left, the <br />
bride of pride leased to the stranger!He will be quite within the pale <br />
when with lordbeeron brow he vows him so tosset to be of the sir <br />
Blake tribes bleak while through life’s unblest he rodes backs of <br />
bannars. Are you not somewhat bulgar with your bowels? <br />
Whatever do you mean with bleak? With pale blake I write tint- <br />
ingface. O, you do? And with steelwhite and blackmail I ha’scint <br />
for my sweet an anemone’s letter with a gold of my bridest hair <br />
betied. Donatus his mark, address as follows. So you did? From <br />
the Cat and Cage. O, I see and see! In the ink of his sweat <br />
he will find it yet. What Gipsy Devereux vowed to Lylian and <br />
why the elm and how the stone. You never may know in the <br />
preterite all perhaps that you would not believe that you ever <br />
even saw to be about to. Perhaps. But they are two very blizky <br />
little portereens after their bredscrums, Jerkoff and Eatsup, as <br />
for my part opinion indeed. They would be born so, costarred, <br />
puck and prig, the maryboy at Donnybrook Fair, the godolphing- <br />
lad in the Hoy’s Court. How frilled one shall be as at taledold of <br />
Formio and Cigalette! What folly innocents! Theirs whet pep of <br />
puppyhood! Both barmhearts shall become yeastcake by their <br />
brackfest. I will to leave a my copperwise blessing between the <br />
pair of them, for rosengorge, for greenafang. Blech and tin soldies, <br />
weals in a sniffbox. Som’s wholed, all’s parted. Weeping shouldst <br />
not thou be when man falls but that divine scheming ever adoring <br />
be. So you be either man or mouse and you be neither fish nor <br />
flesh. Take. And take. Vellicate nyche! Be ones as wes for gives for <br />
gives now the hour of passings sembles quick with quelled. Adieu, <br />
soft adieu, for these nice presents, kerryjevin. Still tosorrow!</p>
