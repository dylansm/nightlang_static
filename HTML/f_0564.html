<p>Jeminy, what is the view which now takes up a second posi- <br />
tion of discordance, tell it please? Mark! You notice it in that <br />
rereway because the male entail partially eclipses the femecovert. <br />
It is so called for its discord the meseedo. Do you ever heard the <br />
story about Helius Croesus, that white and gold elephant in our <br />
zoopark? You astonish me by it. Is it not that we are command- <br />
ing from fullback, woman permitting, a profusely fine birdseye <br />
view from beauhind this park? Finn his park has been much the <br />
admiration of all the stranger ones, grekish and romanos, who <br />
arrive to here. The straight road down the centre (see relief map) <br />
bisexes the park which is said to be the largest of his kind in the <br />
world. On the right prominence confronts you the handsome <br />
vinesregent’s lodge while, turning to the other supreme piece of <br />
cheeks, exactly opposite, you are confounded by the equally hand- <br />
some chief sacristary’s residence. Around is a little amiably tufted <br />
and man is cheered when he bewonders through the boskage <br />
how the nature in all frisko is enlivened by gentlemen’s seats. <br />
Here are heavysuppers<span class="em">—</span>’tis for daddies housings for hun- <br />
dredaires of our super thin thousand. By gum, but you have <br />
resin! Of these tallworts are yielded out juices for jointoils and <br />
pappasses for paynims. Listeneth! ’Tis a tree story. How olave, <br />
that firile, was aplantad in her liveside. How tannoboom held <br />
tonobloom. How rood in norlandes. The black and blue marks <br />
athwart the weald, which now barely is so stripped, indicate the <br />
presence of sylvious beltings. Therewithal shady rides lend <br />
themselves out to rustic cavalries. In yonder valley, too, <br />
stays mountain sprite. Any pretty dears are to be caught inside <br />
but it is a bad pities of the plain. A scarlet pimparnell now <br />
mules the mound where anciently first murders were wanted <br />
to take root. By feud fionghalian. Talkingtree and sinningstone <br />
stay on either hand. Hystorical leavesdroppings may also be gar- <br />
nered up with sir Shamus Swiftpatrick, Archfieldchaplain of Saint <br />
Lucan’s. How familiar it is to see all these interesting advenements <br />
with one snaked’s eyes! Is all? Yet not. Hear one’s. At the bodom <br />
fundus of this royal park, which, with tvigate shyasian gardeenen, <br />
is open to the public till night at late, so well the sissastrides so will<span></span></p>
