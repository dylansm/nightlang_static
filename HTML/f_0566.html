<p class="ni">blank! For it’s race pound race the hosties rear all roads to ruin <br />
and layers by lifetimes laid down riches from poormen. Cried <br />
unions to chip, saltpetre to strew, gallpitch to drink, stonebread <br />
to break but it’s bully to gulp good blueberry pudding. Doze <br />
in your warmth! While the elves in the moonbeams, feeling why, <br />
will keep my lilygem gently gleaming.</p>

<p>In the sleepingchambers. The court to go into half morning. <br />
The four seneschals with their palfrey to be there now, all <br />
balaaming in their sellaboutes and sharping up their penisills. The <br />
boufeither Soakersoon at holdup tent sticker. The swabsister <br />
Katya to have duntalking and to keep shakenin dowan her drogh- <br />
edars. Those twelve chief barons to stand by duedesmally with <br />
their folded arums and put down all excursions and false alarums <br />
and after that to go back now to their runameat farums and re- <br />
compile their magnum chartarums with the width of the road <br />
between them and all harrums. The maidbrides all, in favours <br />
gay, to strew sleety cinders on their falling hair and for wouldbe <br />
joybells to ring sadly ringless hands. The dame dowager to stay <br />
kneeled how she is, as first mutherer with cord in coil. The two <br />
princes of the tower royal, daulphin and deevlin, to lie how they <br />
are without to see. The dame dowager’s duffgerent to present <br />
wappon, blade drawn to the full and about wheel without to be <br />
seen of them. The infant Isabella from her coign to do obeisance <br />
toward the duffgerent, as first futherer with drawn brand. Then <br />
the court to come in to full morning. Herein see ye fail not!
