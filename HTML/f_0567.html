<p class="ni">leary obelisk via the rock vhat myles knox furlongs; to the <br />
general’s postoffice howsands of patience; to the Wellington <br />
memorial half a league wrongwards; to Sara’s bridge good hun- <br />
ter and nine to meet her: to the point, one yeoman’s yard. He, he, <br />
he! At that do you leer, a setting up? With a such unfettered belly? <br />
Two cascades? I leer (O my big, O my bog, O my bigbagbone!) <br />
because I must see a buntingcap of so a pinky on the point. It is <br />
for a true glover’s greetings and many burgesses by us, greats <br />
and grosses, uses to pink it in this way at tet-at-tet. For long has <br />
it been effigy of standard royal when broken on roofstaff which <br />
to the gunnings shall cast welcome from Courtmilits’ Fortress, <br />
umptydum dumptydum. Bemark you these hangovers, those <br />
streamer fields, his influx. Do you not have heard that, the queen <br />
lying abroad from fury of the gales, (meekname mocktitles her <br />
Nan Nan Nanetta) her liege of lateenth dignisties shall come on <br />
their bay tomorrow, Michalsmas, mellems the third and fourth of <br />
the clock, there to all the king’s aussies and all their king’s men, <br />
knechts tramplers and cavalcaders, led of herald graycloak, Ulaf <br />
Goldarskield? Dog! Dog! Her lofts will be loosed for her and <br />
their tumblers broodcast. A progress shall be made in walk, ney? I <br />
trow it well, and uge by uge. He shall come, sidesmen accostant, by <br />
aryan jubilarian and on brigadier-general Nolan or and buccaneer- <br />
admiral Browne, with<span class="em">—</span>who can doubt it?<span class="em">—</span>his golden beagles <br />
and his white elkox terriers for a hunting on our littlego illcome <br />
faxes. In blue and buff of Beaufort the hunt shall make. It is <br />
poblesse noblige. Ommes will grin through collars when each <br />
riders other’s ass. Me Eccls! What cats’ killings overall! What <br />
popping out of guillotened widows! Quick time! Beware of <br />
waiting! Squintina plies favours on us from her rushfrail and <br />
Zosimus, the crowder, in his surcoat, sues us with souftwister. <br />
Apart we! Here are gantlets. I believe, by Plentifolks Mixymost! <br />
Yet if I durst to express the hope how I might be able to be pre- <br />
sent. All these peeplers entrammed and detrained on bikeygels <br />
and troykakyls and those puny farting little solitires! Tollacre, <br />
tollacre! Polo north will beseem Sibernian and Plein Pelouta will <br />
behowl ne yerking at lawncastrum ne ghimbelling on guelflinks.<span></span></p>
