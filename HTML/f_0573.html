<p class="ni">Marinuzza, Indra and Iodina, has been tenderly debauched <br />
(in Halliday’s view), by Honuphrius, and Magravius knows <br />
from spies that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege <br />
with Michael, vulgo Cerularius, a perpetual curate, who wishes <br />
to seduce Eugenius. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested <br />
by Sulla, an orthodox savage (and leader of a band of twelve <br />
mercenaries, the Sullivani), who desires to procure Felicia for <br />
Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Macdugalius, four excavators, if <br />
she will not yield to him and also deceive Honuphrius by ren- <br />
dering conjugal duty when demanded. Anita who claims to have <br />
discovered incestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius <br />
would yield to the lewdness of Honuphrius to appease the <br />
savagery of Sulla and the mercernariness of the twelve Sullivani, <br />
and (as Gilbert at first suggested), to save the virginity of <br />
Felicia for Magravius when converted by Michael after the <br />
death of Gillia, but she fears that, by allowing his marital rights <br />
she may cause reprehensible conduct between Eugenius and <br />
Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispen- <br />
ses her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretends publicly to <br />
possess his conjunct in thirtynine several manners (turpiter! <br />
affirm ex cathedris Gerontes Cambronses) for camal hygiene <br />
whenever he has rendered himself impotent to consummate by <br />
subdolence. Anita is disturbed but Michael comminates that <br />
he will reserve her case tomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus <br />
even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication <br />
which, from experience, she knows (according to Wadding), <br />
to be leading to nullity. Fortissa, however, is encouraged by <br />
Gregorius, Leo, Viteilius, and Magdugalius, reunitedly, to warn <br />
Anita by describing the strong chastisements of Honuphrius <br />
and the depravities (turpissimas!) of Canicula, the deceased wife <br />
of Mauritius, with Sulla, the simoniac, who is abnegand and <br />
repents. Has he hegemony and shall she submit?</p>

<p>Translate a lax, you breed a bradaun. In the goods of Cape and <br />
Chattertone, deceased.</p>

<p>This, lay readers and gentilemen, is perhaps the commonest <br />
of all cases arising out of umbrella history in connection with<span></span></p>
