holds (though Finn Magnusson of himself holds also) that so <br />
long as there is a joint deposit account in the two names a <br />
mutual obligation is posited. Owens cites Brerfuchs and Warren, <br />
a foreign firm, since disseized, registered as Tangos, Limited, <br />
for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action which was <br />
at the instance of the trustee of the heathen church emergency <br />
fund, suing by its trustee, a resigned civil servant, for the pay- <br />
ment of tithes due was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a com- <br />
mon jury. No question arose as to the debt for which vouchers <br />
spoke volumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made <br />
effective. The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecun- <br />
dus Coppercheap, counterclaimed that payment was invalid <br />
having been tendered to creditor under cover of a crossed cheque, <br />
signed in the ordinary course, in the name of Wieldhelm, Hurls <br />
Cross, voucher copy provided, and drawn by the senior partner <br />
only by whom the lodgment of the species had been effected but <br />
in their joint names. The bank particularised, the national misery <br />
(now almost entirely in the hands of the four chief bondholders <br />
for value in Tangos), declined to pay the draft, though there <br />
were ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trusty <br />
Coppercheap negociated it for and on behalf of the fund of the <br />
thing to a client of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he <br />
received in exchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust, <br />
with thanks. Since then the cheque, a good washable pink, em- <br />
bossed D you D No 11 hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure <br />
and face, had been circulating in the country for over thirtynine <br />
years among holders of Pango stock, a rival concern, though not <br />
one demonetised farthing had ever spun or fluctuated across the <br />
counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquid cash. The jury (a <br />
sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiously named <br />
after doyles) naturally disagreed jointly and severally, and the <br />
belligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors’ disagree- <br />
ment, went outside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a gar- <br />
nishee attachment to the neutral firm. No mandamus could lo- <br />
