and only the junior partner Barren could be found, who entered an <br />
appearance and turned up, upon a notice of motion and after service <br />
of the motion by interlocutory injunction, among the male jurors <br />
to be an absolete turfwoman, originally from the proletarian class, <br />
with still a good title to her sexname of Ann Doyle, 2 Coppinger’s <br />
Cottages, the Doyle’s country. Doyle (Ann), add woman in, <br />
having regretfully left the juryboxers, protested cheerfully on the <br />
stand in a long jurymiad in re corset checks, delivered in doy- <br />
lish, that she had often, in supply to brusk demands rising almost <br />
to bollion point, discounted Mr Brakeforth’s first of all in ex- <br />
