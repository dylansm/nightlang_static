<p class="ni">scabie, handed down to the jury of the Liffey that, as a matter of <br />
tact, the woman they gave as free was born into contractual in- <br />
capacity (the Calif of Man v the Eaudelusk Company) when, how <br />
and where mamy’s mancipium act did not apply and therefore held <br />
supremely that, as no property in law can exist in a corpse, <br />
(Hal Kilbride v Una Bellina) Pepigi’s pact was pure piffle (loud <br />
laughter) and Wharrem would whistle for the rhino. Will you, <br />
won’t you, pango with Pepigi? Not for Nancy, how dare you do! <br />
And whew whewwhew whew.
<span class="em">—</span>He sighed in sleep.
<span class="em">—</span>Let us go back.
<span class="em">—</span>Lest he forewaken.
<span class="em">—</span>Hide ourselves.</p>

<p>While hovering dreamwings, folding around, will hide from <br />
fears my wee mee mannikin, keep my big wig long strong mano- <br />
men, guard my bairn, mon beau.

<p>Prospector projector and boomooster giant builder of all <br />
causeways woesoever, hopping offpoint and true terminus of <br />
straxstraightcuts and corkscrewn perambulaups, zeal whence to <br />
goal whither, wonderlust, in sequence to which every muckle <br />
must make its mickle, as different as York from Leeds, being the <br />
only wise in a muck’s world to look on itself from beforehand; <br />
mirrorminded curiositease and would-to-the-large which bring <br />
hills to molehunter, home through first husband, perils behind <br />
swine and horsepower down to hungerford, prick this man and <br />
tittup this woman, our forced payrents, Bogy Bobow with his <br />
cunnyngnest couchmare, Big Maester Finnykin with Phenicia <br />
Parkes, lame of his ear and gape of her leg, most correctingly, <br />
we beseach of you, down their laddercase of nightwatch service <br />
and bring them at suntime flush with the nethermost gangrung <br />
of their stepchildren, guide them through the labyrinth of their <br />
samilikes and the alteregoases of their pseudoselves, hedge them <br />
bothways from all roamers whose names are ligious, from loss <br />
of bearings deliver them; so they keep to their rights and be <br />
ware of duty frees, neoliffic smith and magdalenian jinnyjones,<span></span></p>
