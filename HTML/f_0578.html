<p>But. Oom Godd his villen, who will he be, this mitryman, some <br />
king of the yeast, in his chrismy greyed brunzewig, with the snow <br />
in his mouth and the caspian asthma, so bulk of build? Relics of <br />
pharrer and livite! Dik Gill, Tum Lung or Macfinnan’s cool <br />
Harryng? He has only his hedcosycasket on and his wollsey <br />
shirtplisse with peascod doublet, also his feet wear doubled width <br />
socks for he always must to insure warm sleep between a pair of <br />
fullyfleeced bankers like a finnoc in a cauwl. Can thus be Misthra <br />
Norkmann that keeps our hotel? Begor, Mr O’Sorgmann, you’re <br />
looking right well! Hecklar’s champion ethnicist. How deft as a <br />
fuchser schouws daft as a fish! He’s the dibble’s own doges for <br />
doublin existents! But a jolly fine daysent form of one word. <br />
He’s rounding up on his family.</p>

<p>And who is the bodikin by him, sir? So voulzievalsshie? With <br />
ybbs and zabs? Her trixiestrail is tripping her, vop! Luck at the <br />
way for the lucre of smoke she’s looping the lamp! Why, that’s <br />

watter! Ardechious me! With her halfbend as proud as a peahen, <br />
allabalmy, and her troutbeck quiverlipe, ninyananya. And her <br />
steptojazyma’s culunder buzztle. Happy tea area, naughtygay <br />
frew! Selling sunlit sopes to washtout winches and rhaincold <br />
draughts to the props of his pubs. She tired lipping the swells at <br />
Pont Delisle till she jumped the boom at Brounemouth. Now <br />
she’s borrid his head under Hatesbury’s Hatch and loamed his <br />
fate to old Love Lane. And she’s just the same old haporth of <br />
dripping. She’s even brennt her hair.</p>

<p>Which route are they going? Why? Angell sitter or Amen <br />
Corner, Norwood’s Southwalk or Euston Waste? The solvent <br />
man in his upper gambeson withnot a breth against him and the <br />
wee wiping womanahoussy. They’re coming terug their dia- <br />
