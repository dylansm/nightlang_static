<p class="ni">shipchild with the waif of his bosun, Dunmow’s flitcher with <br />
duck-on-the-rock, down the scales, the way they went up, <br />
under talls and threading tormentors, shunning the startraps and <br />
slipping in sliders, risking a runway, ruing reveals, from Elder <br />
Arbor to La Puiree, eskipping the clockback, crystal in carbon, <br />
sweetheartedly. Hot and cold and electrickery with attendance <br />
and lounge and promenade free. In spite of all that science could <br />
boot or art could eke. Bolt the grinden. Cave and can em. <br />
Single wrecks for the weak, double axe for the mail, and quick <br />
queck quack for the radiose. Renove that bible. You will never <br />
have post in your pocket unless you have brasse on your plate. <br />
Beggards outdoor. Goat to the Endth, thou slowguard! Mind <br />
the Monks and their Grasps. Scrape your souls. Commit no <br />
miracles. Postpone no bills. Respect the uniform. Hold the raa- <br />
bers for the kunning his plethoron. Let leash the dooves to the <br />
cooin her coynth. Hatenot havenots. Share the wealth and spoil <br />
the weal. Peg the pound to tom the devil. My time is on draught. <br />
Bottle your own. Love my label like myself. Earn before eating. <br />
Drudge after drink. Credit tomorrow. Follow my dealing. Fetch <br />
my price. Buy not from dives. Sell not to freund. Herenow chuck <br />
english and learn to pray plain. Lean on your lunch. No cods <br />
before Me. Practise preaching. Think in your stomach. Import <br />
through the nose. By faith alone. Season’s weather. Gomorrha. <br />
Salong. Lots feed from my tidetable. Oil’s wells in our lands. Let <br />
earwigger’s wivable teach you the dance!</p>

<p>Now their laws assist them and ease their fall!</p>

<p>For they met and mated and bedded and buckled and got and <br />
gave and reared and raised and brought Thawland within Har <br />
danger, and turned them, tarrying to the sea and planted and <br />
plundered and pawned our souls and pillaged the pounds of the <br />
extramurals and fought and feigned with strained relations and <br />
bequeathed us their ills and recrutched cripples gait and under- <br />
mined lungachers, manplanting seven sisters while wan warm- <br />
wooed woman scrubbs, and turned out coats and removed their <br />
origins and never learned the first day’s lesson and tried to <br />
mingle and managed to save and feathered foes’ nests and fouled<span></span></p>
