on her orbits, and the heave of his juniper arx in action, he’s <br />
naval I see. Poor little tartanelle, her dinties are chattering, the <br />
strait’s she’s in, the bulloge she bears! Her smirk is smeeching <br />
behind for her hills. By the queer quick twist of her mobcap and <br />
the lift of her shift at random and the rate of her gate of going <br />
the pace, two thinks at a time, her country I’m proud of. The <br />
field is down, the race is their own. The galleonman jovial on his <br />
bucky brown nightmare. Bigrob dignagging his lylyputtana. <br />
One to one bore one! The datter, io, io, sleeps in peace, in peace. <br />
And the twillingsons, ganymede, garrymore, turn in trot and <br />
trot. But old pairamere goes it a gallop, a gallop. Bossford and <br />
phospherine. One to one on!</p>

<p>O, O, her fairy setalite! Casting such shadows to Persia’s <br />
blind! The man in the street can see the coming event. Photo- <br />
flashing it far too wide. It will be known through all Urania soon. <br />
Like jealousjoy titaning fear; like rumour rhean round the planets; <br />
like china’s dragon snapping japets; like rhodagrey up the east. <br />
Satyrdaysboost besets Phoebe’s nearest. Here’s the flood and the <br />
flaxen flood that’s to come over helpless Irryland. Is there no-one <br />
to malahide Liv and her bettyship? Or who’ll buy her rosebuds, <br />
jettyblack rosebuds, ninsloes of nivia, nonpaps of nan? From the <br />
fall of the fig to doom’s last post every ephemeral anniversary while <br />
the park’s police peels peering by for to weight down morrals from <br />
county bubblin. That trainer’s trundling! Quick, pay up!</p>

<p>Kickakick. She had to kick a laugh. At her old stick-in-the- <br />
block. The way he was slogging his paunch about, elbiduubled, <br />

maker’s mace and waxened capapee. But the tarrant’s brand on <br />
his hottoweyt brow. At half past quick in the morning. And her <br />
lamp was all askew and a trumbly wick-in-her, ringeysingey. <br />
She had to spofforth, she had to kicker, too thick of the wick <br />
of her pixy’s loomph, wide lickering jessup the smooky shiminey. <br />
And her duffed coverpoint of a wickedy batter, whenever she <br />
