<p class="ni">stoddard and trutted and trumpered, to see had lordherry’s <br />
blackham’s red bobby abbels, it tickled her innings to consort <br />
pitch at kicksolock in the morm. Tipatonguing him on in her <br />
pigeony linguish, with a flick at the bails for lubrication, to scorch <br />
her faster, faster. Ye hek, ye hok, ye hucky hiremonger! Magrath <br />
he’s my pegger, he is, for bricking up all my old kent road. <br />
He’ll win your toss, flog your old tom’s bowling and I darr ye, <br />
barrackybuller, to break his duck! He’s posh. I lob him. We’re <br />
parring all Oogster till the empsyseas run googlie. Declare to <br />
ashes and teste his metch! Three for two will do for me and he <br />
for thee and she for you. Goeasyosey, for the grace of the fields, <br />
or hooley pooley, cuppy, we’ll both be bye and by caught in the <br />
slips for fear he’d tyre and burst his dunlops and waken her <br />
bornybarnies making his boobybabies. The game old merri- <br />
mynn, square to leg, with his lolleywide towelhat and his hobbsy <br />
socks and his wisden’s bosse and his norsery pinafore and his <br />
gentleman’s grip and his playaboy’s plunge and his flannelly <br />
feelyfooling, treading her hump and hambledown like a maiden <br />
wellheld, ovalled over, with her crease where the pads of her <br />
punishments ought to be by womanish rights when, keek, the hen <br />
in the doran’s shantyqueer began in a kikkery key to laugh it <br />
off, yeigh, yeigh, neigh, neigh, the way she was wuck to doodle- <br />
doo by her gallows bird (how’s that? Noball, he carries his bat!) <br />
nine hundred and dirty too not out, at all times long past con- <br />
quering cock of the morgans.</p>

<p>How blame us?</p>

<p>Cocorico!</p>

<p>Armigerend everfasting horde. Rico! So the bill to the bowe. <br />
As the belle to the beau. We herewith pleased returned auditors’ <br />
thanks for those and their favours since safely enjoined. Coco- <br />
ree! Tellaman tillamie. Tubbernacul in tipherairy, sons, travel- <br />
lers in company and their carriageable tochters, tanks tight anne <br />
thynne for her contractations tugowards his personeel. Echo, <br />
choree chorecho! O I you O you me! Well, we all unite thought- <br />
fully in rendering gratias, well, between loves repassed, begging <br />
your honour’s pardon for, well, exclusive pigtorial rights of here-<span></span></p>
