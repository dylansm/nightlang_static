Master Mettresson who so kindly profiteered their serwishes as <br />
demysell of honour and, well, as strainbearer respectively. <br />
And a cordiallest brief nod of chinchin dankyshin to, well, patient <br />

Humbo, lock your kekkle up! Anny, blow your wickle out! <br />
Tuck away the tablesheet! You never wet the tea! And you <br />
