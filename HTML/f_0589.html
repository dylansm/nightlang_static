dotted our green with tricksome couples, fiftyfifty, their chil- <br />
tren’s hundred. So childish pence took care of parents’ pounds <br />
and many made money the way in the world where rushroads <br />
to riches crossed slums of lice and, the cause of it all, he forged <br />
himself ahead like a blazing urbanorb, brewing treble to drown <br />
grief, giving and taking mayom and tuam, playing milliards with <br />
his three golden balls, making party capital out of landed self- <br />
interest, light on a slavey but weighty on the bourse, our hugest <br />
commercial emporialist, with his sons booing home from afar <br />
and his daughters bridling up at his side. Finner!</p>

<p>How did he bank it up, swank it up, the whaler in the punt, <br />

walls and the slate for accounts his keeper was cooking. Then <br />
came three boy buglehorners who counterbezzled and cross- <br />
