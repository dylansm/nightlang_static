<p class="ni">worn. Soe? La! Lamfadar’s arm it has cocoincidences. You mean <br />
to see we have been hadding a sound night’s sleep? You may so. <br />
It is just, it is just about to, it is just about to rolywholyover. <br />
Svapnasvap. Of all the stranger things that ever not even in the <br />
hundrund and badst pageans of unthowsent and wonst nice or <br />
in eddas and oddes bokes of tomb, dyke and hollow to be have <br />
happened! The untireties of livesliving being the one substrance <br />
of a streamsbecoming. Totalled in toldteld and teldtold in tittle- <br />
tell tattle. Why? Because, graced be Gad and all giddy gadgets, <br />
in whose words were the beginnings, there are two signs to tum <br />
to, the yest and the ist, the wright side and the wronged side, <br />
feeling aslip and wauking up, so an, so farth. Why? On the sourd- <br />
site we have the Moskiosk Djinpalast with its twin adjacencies, <br />
the bathouse and the bazaar, allahallahallah, and on the sponthe- <br />
site it is the alcovan and the rosegarden, boony noughty, all pura- <br />
puthry. Why? One’s apurr apuss a story about brid and break- <br />
fedes and parricombating and coushcouch but others is of tholes <br />
and oubworn buyings, dolings and chafferings in heat, contest <br />
and enmity. Why? Every talk has his stay, vidnis Shavarsanjivana, <br />
and all-a-dreams perhapsing under lucksloop at last are through. <br />
Why? It is a sot of a swigswag, systomy dystomy, which evera- <br />
body you ever anywhere at all doze. Why? Such me.</p>

<p>And howpsadrowsay.</p>

<p>Lok! A shaft of shivery in the act, anilancinant. Cold’s sleuth! <br />
Vayuns! Where did thots come from? It is infinitesimally fevers, <br />
resty fever, risy fever, a coranto of aria, sleeper awakening, in <br />
the smalls of one’s back presentiment, gip, and again, geip, a <br />
flash from a future of maybe mahamayability through the windr <br />
of a wondr in a wildr is a weltr as a wirbl of a warbl is a world.</p>

<p>Tom.</p>

<p>It is perfect degrees excelsius. A jaladaew still stilleth. Cloud <br />
lay but mackrel are. Anemone activescent, the torporature is re- <br />
turning to mornal. Humid nature is feeling itself freely at ease <br />
with the all fresco. The vervain is to herald as the grass admini- <br />
sters. They say, they say in effect, they really say. You have eaden <br />
fruit. Say whuit. You have snakked mid a fish. Telle whish.<span></span></p>
