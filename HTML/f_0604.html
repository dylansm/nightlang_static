<p class="ni">peechy. Say he that saw him that saw! Man shall sharp run <br />
do a get him. Ask no more, Jerry mine, Roga’s voice! No <br />
pice soorkabatcha. The bog which puckerooed the posy. The <br />
vinebranch of Heremonheber on Bregia’s plane where Teffia lies <br />
is leaved invert and fructed proper but the cublic hatches endnot <br />
open yet for hourly rincers’ mess. Read Higgins, Cairns and Egen. <br />
Malthus is yet lukked in close. Withun. How swathed there- <br />
answer alcove makes theirinn! Besoakers loiter on. And primi- <br />
libatory solicates of limon sodias will be absorbable. It is <br />
not even yet the engine of the load with haled morries full of <br />
crates, you mattinmummur, for dombell dumbs? Sure and ’tis <br />
not then. The greek Sideral Reulthway, as it havvents, will soon <br />
be starting a smooth with its first single hastencraft. Danny buz- <br />
zers instead of the vialact coloured milk train on the fartykket <br />
plan run with its endless gallaxion of rotatorattlers and the smool- <br />
troon our elderens rememberem as the scream of the service, <br />
Strubry Bess. Also the waggonwobblers are still yet everdue to <br />
precipitate after night’s combustion. Aspect, Shamus Rogua or! <br />
Taceate and! Hagiographice canat Ecclesia. Which aubrey our <br />

that to what’s that, what.</p>

<p>Oyes! Oyeses! Oyesesyeses! The primace of the Gaulls, pro- <br />
tonotorious, I yam as I yam, mitrogenerand in the free state on <br />
the air, is now aboil to blow a Gael warning. Inoperation Eyr- <br />
lands Eyot, Meganesia, Habitant and the onebut thousand insels, <br />
Western and Osthern Approaches.</p>

<p>Of Kevin, of increate God the servant, of the Lord Creator a <br />
filial fearer, who, given to the growing grass, took to the tall tim- <br />
ber, slippery dick the springy heeler, as we have seen, so we <br />
have heard, what we have received, that we have transmitted, <br />
thus we shall hope, this we shall pray till, in the search for <br />
love of knowledge through the comprehension of the unity in <br />
altruism through stupefaction, it may again how it may again, <br />
shearing aside the four wethers and passing over the dainty daily <br />
dairy and dropping by the way the lapful of live coals and <br />
smoothing out Nelly Nettle and her lad of mettle, full of stings,<span></span></p>
