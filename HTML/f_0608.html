<p>It is a mere mienerism of this vague of visibilities, mark you, <br />
as accorded to by moisturologist of the Brehons Assorceration for <br />
the advauncement of scayence because, my dear, mentioning of <br />
it under the breath, as in pure (what bunkum!) essenesse, there <br />
have been disselving forenenst you just the draeper, the two <br />
drawpers assisters and the three droopers assessors confraterni- <br />
tisers. Who are, of course, Uncle Arth, your two cozes from <br />
Niece and (kunject a bit now!) our own familiars, Billyhealy, Bally- <br />
hooly and Bullyhowley, surprised in an indecorous position by <br />
the Sigurd Sigerson Sphygmomanometer Society for bled- <br />
prusshers.</p>

<p>Knightsmore. Haventyne?</p>

<p>Ha ha!</p>

<p>This Mister Ireland? And a live?</p>

<p>Ay, ay. Aye, aye, baas.</p>

<p>The cry of Stena chills the vitals of slumbring off the motther <br />
has been pleased into the harms of old salaciters, meassurers <br />
soon and soon, but the voice of Alina gladdens the cockly- <br />

chang chap sugay kaow laow milkee muchee bringing becker- <br />
brose, the brew with the foochoor in it. Sawyest? Nodt? Nyets, <br />
I dhink I sawn to remumb or sumbsuch. A kind of a thinglike <br />
all traylogged then pubably it resymbles a pelvic or some kvind <br />
then props an acutebacked quadrangle with aslant off ohahn- <br />
thenth a wenchyoumaycuddler, lying with her royalirish upper- <br />
shoes among the theeckleaves. Signs are on of a mere by token <br />
that wills still to be becoming upon this there once a here was <br />
world. As the dayeleyves unfolden them. In the wake of the <br />
blackshape, Nattenden Sorte; whenat, hindled firth and hundled <br />
furth, the week of wakes is out and over; as a wick weak woking <br />
from ennemberable Ashias unto fierce force fuming, temtem <br />
tamtam, the Phoenican wakes.</p>

<p>Passing. One. We are passing. Two. From sleep we are pass- <br />

Four. Come, hours, be ours!</p>

<p>But still. Ah diar, ah diar! And stay.</p>
