<p class="ni">of the past; type by tope, letter from litter, word at ward, with <br />
sendence of sundance, since the days of Plooney and Colum- <br />
cellas when Giacinta, Pervenche and Margaret swayed over the <br />
all-too-ghoulish and illyrical and innumantic in our mutter nation, <br />
all, anastomosically assimilated and preteridentified paraidioti- <br />
cally, in fact, the sameold gamebold adomic structure of our <br />
Finnius the old One, as highly charged with electrons as hophaz- <br />
ards can effective it, may be there for you, Cockalooralooraloo- <br />
menos, when cup, platter and pot come piping hot, as sure as <br />
herself pits hen to paper and there’s scribings scrawled on eggs.</p>

<p>Of cause, so! And in effect, as?</p>

<p>Dear. And we go on to Dirtdump. Reverend. May we add <br />
majesty? Well, we have frankly enjoyed more than anything <br />
these secret workings of natures (thanks ever for it, we humbly <br />
pray) and, well, was really so denighted of this lights time. <br />
Mucksrats which bring up about uhrweckers they will come to <br />
know good. Yon clouds will soon disappear looking forwards <br />
at a fine day. The honourable Master Sarmon they should be <br />
first born like he was with a twohangled warpon and it was <br />
between Williamstown and the Mairrion Ailesbury on the top <br />
of the longcar, as merrily we rolled along, we think of him looking <br />
at us yet as if to pass away in a cloud. When he woke up in a <br />
sweat besidus it was to pardon him, goldylocks, me having an <br />
airth, but he daydreamsed we had a lovelyt face for a pulltomine. <br />
Back we were by the jerk of a bearnstark, backed in paladays last, <br />
on the brinks of the wobblish, the man what never put a dramn <br />
in the swags but milk from a national cowse. That was the prick <br />
of the spindle to me that gave me the keys to dreamland. Sneakers <br />
in the grass, keep off! If we were to tick off all that cafflers head, <br />
whisperers for his accomodation, the me craws, namely, and their <br />
bacon what harmed butter! It’s margarseen oil. Thinthin thin- <br />
thin. Stringstly is it forbidden by the honorary tenth commend- <br />
mant to shall not bare full sweetness against a nighboor’s wiles. <br />
What those slimes up the cavern door around you, keenin, (the <br />
lies is coming out on them frecklefully) had the shames to suggest <br />
can we ever? Never! So may the low forget him their trespasses<span></span></p>
