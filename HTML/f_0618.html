<p class="ni">innocenth eyes. O, felicious coolpose! If all the MacCrawls would <br />
only handle virgils like Armsworks, Limited! That’s handsel for <br />
gertles! Never mind Micklemans! Chat us instead! The cad <br />
with the pope’s wife, Lily Kinsella, who became the wife of <br />
Mr Sneakers for her good name in the hands of the kissing <br />
solicitor, will now engage in attentions. Just a prinche for to- <br />
night! Pale bellies our mild cure, back and streaky ninepace. <br />
The thicks off Bully’s Acre was got up by Sully. The Boot lane <br />
brigade. And she had a certain medicine brought her in a <br />
licenced victualler’s bottle. Shame! Thrice shame! We are <br />
advised the waxy is at the present in the Sweeps hospital and <br />
that he may never come out! Only look through your leather- <br />
box one day with P.C.Q. about 4.32 or at 8 and 22.5 with the <br />
quart of scissions masters and clerk and the bevyhum of Marie <br />
Reparatrices for a good allround sympowdhericks purge, full view, <br />
to be surprised to see under the grand piano Lily on the sofa (and <br />
a lady!) pulling a low and then he’d begin to jump a little bit to <br />
find out what goes on when love walks in besides the solicitous <br />
bussness by kissing and looking into a mirror.</p>

<p>That we were treated not very grand when the police and <br />
everybody is all bowing to us when we go out in all directions <br />
on Wanterlond Road with my cubarola glide? And, personably <br />
speaking, they can make their beaux to my alce, as Hillary Allen <br />
sang to the opernnine knighters. Item, we never were chained to a <br />
chair, and, bitem, no widower whother soever followed us about <br />
with a fork on Yankskilling Day. Meet a great civilian (proud <br />
lives to him!) who is gentle as a mushroom and a very affectable <br />
when he always sits forenenst us for his wet while to all whom <br />
it may concern Sully is a thug from all he drunk though he is a <br />
rattling fine bootmaker in his profession. Would we were here- <br />
arther to lodge our complaint on sergeant Laraseny in consequence <br />
of which in such steps taken his health would be constably broken <br />
into potter’s pance which would be the change of his life by a <br />
Nollwelshian which has been oxbelled out of crispianity.</p>

<p>Well, our talks are coming to be resumed by more polite con- <br />
versation with a huntered persent human over the natural bestness<span></span></p>
