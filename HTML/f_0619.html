While for whoever likes that urogynal pan of cakes one apiece it is <br />
thanks, beloved, to Adam, our former first Finnlatter and our <br />
grocerest churcher, as per Grippiths’ varuations, for his beautiful <br />
crossmess parzel.</p>

<p>Well, we simply like their demb cheeks, the Rathgarries, <br />
wagging here about around the rhythms in me amphybed and he <br />
being as bothered that he pausably could by the fallth of hampty <br />
damp. Certified reformed peoples, we may add to this stage, are <br />
proptably saying to quite agreeable deef. Here gives your <br />
answer, pigs and scuts! Hence we’ve lived in two worlds. He is <br />
another he what stays under the himp of holth. The herewaker <br />
of our hamefame is his real namesame who will get himself up <br />
and erect, confident and heroic when but, young as of old, for my <br />
daily comfreshenall, a wee one woos.</p>

<p>Alma Luvia, Pollabella. <br />
P.S. Soldier Rollo’s sweetheart. And she’s about fetted up now <br />
with nonsery reams. And rigs out in regal rooms with the ritzies. <br />
Rags! Worns out. But she’s still her deckhuman amber too.</p>

<p>Soft morning, city! Lsp! I am leafy speafing. Lpf! Folty and <br />
folty all the nights have falled on to long my hair. Not a sound, <br />
falling. Lispn! No wind no word. Only a leaf, just a leaf and <br />
then leaves. The woods are fond always. As were we their babes <br />
in. And robins in crews so. It is for me goolden wending. <br />
Unless? Away! Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so <br />
long! Or is it only so mesleems? On your pondered palm. <br />
Reclined from cape to pede. With pipe on bowl. Terce for a <br />
fiddler, sixt for makmerriers, none for a Cole. Rise up now and <br />
aruse! Norvena’s over. I am leafy, your goolden, so you called <br />
me, may me life, yea your goolden, silve me solve, exsogerraider! <br />
You did so drool. I was so sharm. But there’s a great poet in you <br />
too. Stout Stokes would take you offly. So has he as bored me <br />
to slump. But am good and rested. Taks to you, toddy, tan ye! <br />
Yawhawaw. Helpunto min, helpas vin. Here is your shirt, the day <br />
one, come back. The stock, your collar. Also your double brogues. <br />
A comforter as well. And here your iverol and everthelest your<span></span></p>
