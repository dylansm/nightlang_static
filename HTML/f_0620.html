<p class="ni">umbr. And stand up tall! Straight. I want to see you looking fine <br />
for me. With your brandnew big green belt and all. Blooming in <br />
the very lotust and second to nill, Budd! When you’re in the <br />
buckly shuit Rosensharonals near did for you. Fiftyseven and <br />
three, cosh, with the bulge. Proudpurse Alby with his pooraroon <br />
Eireen, they’ll. Pride, comfytousness, enevy! You make me think <br />
of a wonderdecker I once. Or somebalt thet sailder, the man me- <br />
gallant, with the bangled ears. Or an earl was he, at Lucan? Or, <br />
no, it’s the Iren duke’s I mean. Or somebrey erse from the Dark <br />
Countries. Come and let us! We always said we’d. And go abroad. <br />
Rathgreany way perhaps. The childher are still fast. There is no <br />
school today. Them boys is so contrairy. The Head does be <br />
worrying himself. Heel trouble and heal travel. Galliver and <br />
Gellover. Unless they changes by mistake. I seen the likes in <br />
the twinngling of an aye. Som. So oft. Sim. Time after time. <br />
The sehm asnuh. Two bredder as doffered as nors in soun. When <br />
one of him sighs or one of him cries ’tis you all over. No peace <br />
at all. Maybe it’s those two old crony aunts held them out to the <br />
water front. Queer Mrs Quickenough and odd Miss Dodd- <br />
pebble. And when them two has had a good few there isn’t much <br />
more dirty clothes to publish. From the Laundersdale Minssions. <br />
One chap googling the holyboy’s thingabib and this lad wetting <br />
his widdle. You were pleased as Punch, recitating war exploits <br />
and pearse orations to them jackeen gapers. But that night after, <br />
all you were wanton! Bidding me do this and that and the other. <br />
And blowing off to me, hugly Judsys, what wouldn’t you give <br />
to have a girl! Your wish was mewill. And, lo, out of a sky! The <br />
way I too. But her, you wait. Eager to choose is left to her shade. <br />
If she bad only more matcher’s wit. Findlings makes runaways, <br />
runaways a stray. She’s as merry as the gricks still. ’Twould be <br />
sore should ledden sorrow. I’ll wait. And I’ll wait. And then if <br />
all goes. What will be is. Is is. But let them. Slops hospodch and <br />
the slusky slut too. He’s for thee what she’s for me. Dogging you <br />
round cove and haven and teaching me the perts of speech. If you <br />
spun your yarns to him on the swishbarque waves I was spelling <br />
my yearns to her over cottage cake. We’ll not disturb their sleep-<span></span></p>
