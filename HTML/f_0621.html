<p class="ni">ing duties. Let besoms be bosuns. It’s Phoenix, dear. And the <br />
flame is, hear! Let’s our joornee saintomichael make it. Since the <br />
lausafire has lost and the book of the depth is. Closed. Come! <br />
Step out of your shell! Hold up you free fing! Yes. We’ve light <br />
enough. I won’t take our laddy’s lampern. For them four old <br />
windbags of Gustsofairy to be blowing at. Nor you your ruck- <br />
sunck. To bring all the dannymans out after you on the hike. Send <br />
Arctur guiddus! Isma! Sft! It is the softest morning that ever I <br />
can ever remember me. But she won’t rain showerly, our Ilma. Yet. <br />
Until it’s the time. And me and you have made our. The sons of <br />
bursters won in the games. Still I’ll take me owld Finvara for my <br />
shawlders. The trout will be so fine at brookfisht. With a taste <br />
of roly polony from Blugpuddels after. To bring out the tang of <br />
the tay. Is’t you fain for a roost brood? Oaxmealturn, all out of <br />
the woolpalls! And then all the chippy young cuppinjars clutter- <br />
ing round us, clottering for their creams. Crying, me, grownup <br />
sister! Are me not truly? Lst! Only but, theres a but, you must <br />
buy me a fine new girdle too, nolly. When next you go to Market <br />
Norwall. They’re all saying I need it since the one from Isaacsen’s <br />
slooped its line. Mrknrk? Fy arthou! Come! Give me your great <br />
bearspaw, padder avilky, fol a miny tiny. Dola. Mineninecy- <br />
handsy, in the languo of flows. That’s Jorgen Jargonsen. But you <br />
understood, nodst? I always know by your brights and shades. <br />
Reach down. A lil mo. So. Draw back your glave. Hot and hairy, <br />
hugon, is your hand! Here’s where the falskin begins. Smoos as <br />
an infams. One time you told you’d been burnt in ice. And one <br />
time it was chemicalled after you taking a lifeness. Maybe that’s <br />
why you hold your hodd as if. And people thinks you missed the <br />
scaffold. Of fell design. I’ll close me eyes. So not to see. Or see only <br />
a youth in his florizel, a boy in innocence, peeling a twig, a child be- <br />
side a weenywhite steed. The child we all love to place our hope in <br />
for ever. All men has done something. Be the time they’ve come to <br />
the weight of old fletch. We’ll lave it. So. We will take our walk <br />
before in the timpul they ring the earthly bells. In the church <br />
by the hearseyard. Pax Goodmens will. Or the birds start their <br />
treestirm shindy. Look, there are yours off, high on high! And<span></span></p>
