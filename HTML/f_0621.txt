%ni%ing duties. Let besoms be bosuns. It’s Phoenix, dear. And the  
flame is, hear! Let’s our joornee saintomichael make it. Since the  
lausafire has lost and the book of the depth is. Closed. Come!  
Step out of your shell! Hold up you free fing! Yes. We’ve light  
enough. I won’t take our laddy’s lampern. For them four old  
windbags of Gustsofairy to be blowing at. Nor you your ruck-  
sunck. To bring all the dannymans out after you on the hike. Send  
Arctur guiddus! Isma! Sft! It is the softest morning that ever I  
can ever remember me. But she won’t rain showerly, our Ilma. Yet.  
Until it’s the time. And me and you have made our. The sons of  
bursters won in the games. Still I’ll take me owld Finvara for my  
shawlders. The trout will be so fine at brookfisht. With a taste  
of roly polony from Blugpuddels after. To bring out the tang of  
the tay. Is’t you fain for a roost brood? Oaxmealturn, all out of  
the woolpalls! And then all the chippy young cuppinjars clutter-  
ing round us, clottering for their creams. Crying, me, grownup  
sister! Are me not truly? Lst! Only but, theres a but, you must  
buy me a fine new girdle too, nolly. When next you go to Market  
Norwall. They’re all saying I need it since the one from Isaacsen’s  
slooped its line. Mrknrk? Fy arthou! Come! Give me your great  
bearspaw, padder avilky, fol a miny tiny. Dola. Mineninecy-  
handsy, in the languo of flows. That’s Jorgen Jargonsen. But you  
understood, nodst? I always know by your brights and shades.  
Reach down. A lil mo. So. Draw back your glave. Hot and hairy,  
hugon, is your hand! Here’s where the falskin begins. Smoos as  
an infams. One time you told you’d been burnt in ice. And one  
time it was chemicalled after you taking a lifeness. Maybe that’s  
why you hold your hodd as if. And people thinks you missed the  
scaffold. Of fell design. I’ll close me eyes. So not to see. Or see only  
a youth in his florizel, a boy in innocence, peeling a twig, a child be-  
side a weenywhite steed. The child we all love to place our hope in  
for ever. All men has done something. Be the time they’ve come to  
the weight of old fletch. We’ll lave it. So. We will take our walk  
before in the timpul they ring the earthly bells. In the church  
by the hearseyard. Pax Goodmens will. Or the birds start their  
treestirm shindy. Look, there are yours off, high on high! And%j%
