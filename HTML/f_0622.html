<p class="ni">cooshes, sweet good luck they’re cawing you, Coole! You see, <br />
they’re as white as the riven snae. For us. Next peaters poll you <br />
will be elicted or I’m not your elicitous bribe. The Kinsella <br />
woman’s man will never reduce me. A MacGarath O’Cullagh <br />
O’Muirk MacFewney sookadoodling and sweepacheeping round <br />
the lodge of Fjorn na Galla of the Trumpets! It’s like potting the <br />
po to shambe on the dresser or tamming Uncle Tim’s Caubeen <br />
on to the brows of a Viker Eagle. Not such big strides, huddy <br />
foddy! You’ll crush me antilopes I saved so long for. They’re <br />
Penisole’s. And the two goodiest shoeshoes. It is hardly a Knut’s <br />
mile or seven, possumbotts. It is very good for the health of a <br />
morning. With Buahbuah. A gentle motion all around. As <br />
leisure paces. And the helpyourselftoastrool cure’s easy. It seems <br />
so long since, ages since. As if you had been long far away. <br />
Afartodays, afeartonights, and me as with you in thadark. You <br />
will tell me some time if I can believe its all. You know where <br />
I am bringing you? You remember? When I ran berrying after <br />
hucks and haws. With you drawing out great aims to hazel me <br />
from the hummock with your sling. Our cries. I could lead you <br />
there and I still by you in bed. Les go dutc to Danegreven, <br />
nos? Not a soul but ourselves. Time? We have loads on our <br />
hangs. Till Gilligan and Halligan call again to hooligan. And <br />
the rest of the guns. Sullygan eight, from left to right. Olobobo, <br />
ye foxy theagues! The moskors thought to ball you out. Or <br />
the Wald Unicorns Master, Bugley Captain, from the Naul, drawls <br />
up by the door with the Honourable Whilp and the Reverend <br />
Poynter and the two Lady Pagets of Tallyhaugh, Ballyhuntus, <br />
in their riddletight raiding hats for to lift a hereshealth to their <br />
robost, the Stag, evers the Carlton hart. And you needn’t host <br />
out with your duck and your duty, capapole, while they reach <br />
him the glass he never starts to finish. Clap this wis on your poll <br />
and stick this in your ear, wiggly! Beauties don’t answer and the <br />
rich never pays. If you were the enlarged they’d hue in cry you, <br />
Heathtown, Harbourstown, Snowtown, Four Knocks, Fleming- <br />
town, Bodingtown to the Ford of Fyne on Delvin. How they <br />
housed to house you after the Platonic garlens! And all because,<span></span></p>
