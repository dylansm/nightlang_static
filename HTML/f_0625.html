<p class="ni">night when you twicetook me for some Marienne Sherry and <br />
then your Jermyn cousin who signs hers with exes and the beard- <br />
wig I found in your Clarksome bag. Pharaops you’ll play you’re <br />
the king of Aeships. You certainly make the most royal of noises. <br />
I will tell you all sorts of makeup things, strangerous. And show <br />
you to every simple storyplace we pass. Cadmillersfolly, Bellevenue, <br />
Wellcrom, Quid Superabit, villities valleties. Change the plates <br />
for the next course of murphies! Spendlove’s still there and the <br />
canon going strong and so is Claffey’s habits endurtaking and <br />
our parish pomp’s a great warrent. But you’ll have to ask that <br />
same four that named them is always snugging in your bar- <br />
salooner, saying they’re the best relicts of Conal O’Daniel and <br />
writing Finglas since the Flood. That’ll be some kingly work in pro- <br />
gress. But it’s by this route he’ll come some morrow. And I <br />
can signal you all flint and fern are rasstling as we go by. And <br />
you’ll sing thumb a bit and then wise your selmon on it. It is all <br />
so often and still the same to me. Snf? Only turf, wick dear! Clane <br />
turf. You’ve never forgodden batt on tarf, have you, at broin <br />
burroow, what? Mch? Why, them’s the muchrooms, come up <br />
during the night. Look, agres of roofs in parshes. Dom on dam, <br />
dim in dym. And a capital part for olympics to ply at. Steadyon, <br />
Cooloosus! Mind your stride or you’ll knock. While I’m dodging <br />
the dustbins. Look what I found! A lintil pea. And look at here! <br />
This cara weeseed. Pretty mites, my sweetthings, was they poor- <br />
loves abandoned by wholawidey world? Neighboulotts for new- <br />
town. The Eblanamagna you behazyheld loomening up out of the <br />
dumblynass. But the still sama sitta. I’ve lapped so long. As you <br />
said. It fair takes. If I lose my breath for a minute or two don’t <br />
speak, remember! Once it happened, so it may again. Why I’m <br />
all these years within years in soffran, allbeleaved. To hide away <br />
the tear, the parted. It’s thinking of all. The brave that gave their. <br />
The fair that wore. All them that’s gunne. I’ll begin again in a <br />
jiffey. The nik of a nad. How glad you’ll be I waked you! My! <br />
How well you’ll feel! For ever after. First we turn by the vagurin <br />
here and then it’s gooder. So side by side, turn agate, wedding- <br />
town, laud men of Londub! I only hope whole the heavens sees<span></span></p>
