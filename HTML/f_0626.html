<p class="ni">us. For I feel I could near to faint away. Into the deeps. Anna- <br />
mores leep. Let me lean, just a lea, if you le, bowldstrong big- <br />
tider. Allgearls is wea. At times. So. While you’re adamant evar. <br />
Wrhps, that wind as if out of norewere! As on the night of the <br />
Apophanypes. Jumpst shootst throbbst into me mouth like a <br />
bogue and arrohs! Ludegude of the Lashlanns, how he whips <br />
me cheeks! Sea, sea! Here, weir, reach, island, bridge. Where you <br />
meet I. The day. Remember! Why there that moment and us <br />
two only? I was but teen, a tiler’s dot. The swankysuits was <br />
boosting always, sure him, he was like to me fad. But the swag- <br />
gerest swell off Shackvulle Strutt. And the fiercest freaky ever <br />
followed a pining child round the sluppery table with a forkful <br />
of fat. But a king of whistlers. Scieoula! When he’d prop me atlas <br />
against his goose and light our two candles for our singers duohs <br />
on the sewingmachine. I’m sure he squirted juice in his eyes to <br />
make them flash for flightening me. Still and all he was awful <br />
fond to me. Who’ll search for Find Me Colours now on the hilly- <br />
droops of Vikloefells? But I read in Tobecontinued’s tale that while <br />
blubles blows there’ll still be sealskers. There’ll be others but non <br />
so for me. Yed he never knew we seen us before. Night after <br />
night. So that I longed to go to. And still with all. One time you’d <br />
stand fornenst me, fairly laughing, in your bark and tan billows of <br />
branches for to fan me coolly. And I’d lie as quiet as a moss. And <br />
one time you’d rush upon me, darkly roaring, like a great black <br />
shadow with a sheeny stare to perce me rawly. And I’d frozen <br />
up and pray for thawe. Three times in all. I was the pet of everyone <br />
then. A princeable girl. And you were the pantymammy’s Vulking <br />
Corsergoth. The invision of Indelond. And, by Thorror, you <br />
looked it! My lips went livid for from the joy of fear. Like almost <br />
now. How? How you said how you’d give me the keys of me <br />
heart. And we’d be married till delth to uspart. And though dev <br />
do espart. O mine! Only, no, now it’s me who’s got to give. As <br />
duv herself div. Inn this linn. And can it be it’s nnow fforvell? <br />
Illas! I wisht I had better glances to peer to you through this bay- <br />
light’s growing. But you’re changing, acoolsha, you’re changing <br />
from me, I can feel. Or is it me is? I’m getting mixed. Brightening<span></span></p>
