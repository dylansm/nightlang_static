<p class="ni">up and tightening down. Yes, you’re changing, sonhusband, and <br />
you’re turning, I can feel you, for a daughterwife from the hills <br />
again. Imlamaya. And she is coming. Swimming in my hindmoist. <br />
Diveltaking on me tail. Just a whisk brisk sly spry spink spank <br />
sprint of a thing theresomere, saultering. Saltarella come to her <br />
own. I pity your oldself I was used to. Now a younger’s there. <br />
Try not to part! Be happy, dear ones! May I be wrong! For she’ll <br />
be sweet for you as I was sweet when I came down out of me <br />
mother. My great blue bedroom, the air so quiet, scarce a cloud. <br />
In peace and silence. I could have stayed up there for always only. <br />
It’s something fails us. First we feel. Then we fall. And let her rain <br />
now if she likes. Gently or strongly as she likes. Anyway let her <br />
rain for my time is come. I done me best when I was let. Think- <br />
ing always if I go all goes. A hundred cares, a tithe of troubles and <br />
is there one who understands me? One in a thousand of years of <br />
the nights? All me life I have been lived among them but now <br />
they are becoming lothed to me. And I am lothing their little <br />
warm tricks. And lothing their mean cosy turns. And all the <br />
greedy gushes out through their small souls. And all the lazy <br />
leaks down over their brash bodies. How small it’s all! And me <br />
letting on to meself always. And lilting on all the time. I thought <br />
you were all glittering with the noblest of carriage. You’re only <br />
a bumpkin. I thought you the great in all things, in guilt and in <br />
glory. You’re but a puny. Home! My people were not their sort <br />
out beyond there so far as I can. For all the bold and bad and <br />
bleary they are blamed, the seahags. No! Nor for all our wild <br />
dances in all their wild din. I can seen meself among them, alla- <br />
niuvia pulchrabelled. How she was handsome, the wild Amazia, <br />
when she would seize to my other breast! And what is she weird, <br />
haughty Niluna, that she will snatch from my ownest hair! For <br />
’tis they are the stormies. Ho hang! Hang ho! And the clash of <br />
our cries till we spring to be free. Auravoles, they says, never heed <br />
of your name! But I’m loothing them that’s here and all I lothe. <br />
Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O <br />
bitter ending! I’ll slip away before they’re up. They’ll never see. <br />
Nor know. Nor miss me. And it’s old and old it’s sad and old it’s<span></span></p>
